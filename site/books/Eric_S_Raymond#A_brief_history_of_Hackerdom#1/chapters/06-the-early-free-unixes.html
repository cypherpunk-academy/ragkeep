        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-1-1-p0">Into the gap left by the Free Soft­ware Foun­da­ti­on's un­com­ple­ted HURD had step­ped a Hel­sin­ki Uni­ver­si­ty stu­dent named Linus Tor­valds.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-1-2-p0">In 1991 he began de­ve­lo­ping a free Unix ker­nel for 386 ma­chi­nes using the Free Soft­ware Foun­da­ti­on's tool­kit.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-1-3-p0">His in­iti­al, rapid suc­cess attrac­ted many In­ter­net ha­ckers to help him de­ve­lop Linux, a full-fea­tured Unix with ent­i­re­ly free and re-dis­tri­bu­ta­ble sour­ces.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-2-1-p0">Linux was not wi­thout com­pe­ti­tors.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-2-2-p0">In 1991, con­tem­pora­neous­ly with Linus Tor­valds's early ex­pe­ri­ments, Wil­li­am and Lynne Jo­litz were ex­pe­ri­men­tal­ly porting the BSD Unix sour­ces to the 386.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-2-3-p0">Most ob­ser­vers com­pa­ring BSD tech­no­lo­gy with Linus's crude early ef­forts ex­pec­ted that BSD ports would be­co­me the most im­portant free Uni­xes on the PC.</span>

        <a class="p-num" href="#p-6-3">3|</a>
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-3-1-p0">The most im­portant fea­ture of Linux, howe­ver, was not tech­ni­cal but so­cio­lo­gi­cal.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-3-2-p0">Until the Linux de­ve­lop­ment, ever­yo­ne be­lie­ved that any soft­ware as com­plex as an ope­ra­ting sys­tem had to be de­ve­l­o­ped in a ca­re­ful­ly co­or­di­na­ted way by a re­la­tive­ly small, tight­ly-knit group of peop­le.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-3-3-p0">This model was and still is ty­pi­cal of both com­mer­ci­al soft­ware and the great free-soft­ware ca­the­drals built by the Free Soft­ware Foun­da­ti­on in the 1980s; also of the freeBSD/netBSD/OpenBSD pro­jects that spun off from the Jo­lit­zes' ori­gi­nal 386BSD port.</span>

        <a class="p-num" href="#p-6-4">4|</a>
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-4-1-p0">Linux evol­ved in a com­ple­te­ly dif­fe­rent way.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-4-2-p0">From ne­ar­ly the be­gin­ning, it was ra­ther ca­sual­ly ha­cked on by huge num­bers of vol­un­te­ers co­or­di­na­ting only through the In­ter­net.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-4-3-p0">Qua­li­ty was main­tai­ned not by rigid stan­dards or au­to­cra­cy but by the nai­ve­ly sim­ple stra­te­gy of re­leasing every week and get­ting feed­back from hund­reds of users wi­t­hin days, crea­ting a sort of rapid Dar­wi­ni­an selec­tion on the mu­ta­ti­ons in­tro­du­ced by de­ve­l­o­pers.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-4-4-p0">To the ama­ze­ment of al­most ever­yo­ne, this worked quite well.</span>

        <a class="p-num" href="#p-6-5">5|</a>
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-5-1-p0">By late 1993 Linux could com­pe­te on sta­bi­li­ty and re­lia­bi­li­ty with many com­mer­ci­al Uni­xes, and hosted vast­ly more soft­ware.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-5-2-p0">It was even be­gin­ning to attract ports of com­mer­ci­al ap­p­li­ca­ti­ons soft­ware.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-5-3-p0">One in­di­rect ef­fect of this de­ve­lop­ment was to kill off most of the smal­ler pro­prieta­ry Unix ven­dors—wi­thout de­ve­l­o­pers and ha­ckers to sell to, they fol­ded.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-5-4-p0">One of the few sur­vi­vors, BSDI (Ber­ke­ley Sys­tems De­sign, In­cor­po­ra­ted), flou­ris­hed by of­fe­ring full sour­ces with its BSD-based Unix and cul­ti­vat­ing close ties with the ha­cker com­mu­ni­ty.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-6-1-p0">These de­ve­lop­ments were not much re­mar­ked on at the time even wi­t­hin the ha­cker cul­tu­re, and not at all outs­ide it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-6-2-p0">The ha­cker cul­tu­re, de­fy­ing re­pea­ted pre­dic­tions of its de­mi­se, was just be­gin­ning to re­make the com­mer­ci­al-soft­ware world in its own image.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-6-3-p0">It would be five more years, howe­ver, be­fo­re this trend be­ca­me ob­vious.</span>
