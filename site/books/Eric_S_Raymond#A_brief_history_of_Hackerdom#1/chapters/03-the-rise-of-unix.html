        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-1-1-p0">Far from the bright lights of the AR­PA­net, off in the wilds of New Jer­sey, so­me­thing else had been going on since 1969 that would even­tual­ly overs­ha­dow the PDP-10 tra­di­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-1-2-p0">The year of AR­PA­net's birth was also the year that a Bell Labs ha­cker named Ken Thomp­son in­ven­ted Unix.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-2-1-p0">Thomp­son had been in­vol­ved with the de­ve­lop­ment work on a time-sharing OS cal­led Mul­tics, which sha­red com­mon an­ce­stry with ITS.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-2-2-p0">Mul­tics was a test-bed for some im­portant ideas about how the com­ple­xi­ty of an ope­ra­ting sys­tem could be hi­d­den in­si­de it, in­vi­si­ble to the user, and even to most pro­gramm­ers.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-2-3-p0">The idea was to make using Mul­tics from the outs­ide (and pro­gramming for it!) much sim­pler, so that more real work could get done.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-3-1-p0">Bell Labs pul­led out of the pro­ject when Mul­tics dis­play­ed signs of bloa­ting into an unusa­ble white ele­phant (the sys­tem was later mar­ke­ted com­mer­ci­al­ly by Ho­ney­well but never be­ca­me a suc­cess).</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-3-2-p0">Ken Thomp­son mis­sed the Mul­tics en­vi­ron­ment, and began to play at im­ple­men­ting a mix­tu­re of its ideas and some of his own on a sca­ven­ged DEC PDP-7.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-4-1-p0">Ano­ther ha­cker named Den­nis Rit­chie in­ven­ted a new lan­gua­ge cal­led `C' for use under Thomp­son's em­bryo­nic Unix.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-4-2-p0">Like Unix, C was de­si­gned to be plea­sant, un­cons­trai­ning, and fle­xi­ble.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-4-3-p0">In­te­rest in these tools spre­ad at Bell Labs, and they got a boost in 1971 when Thomp­son and Rit­chie won a bid to pro­du­ce what we'd now call an of­fice au­to­ma­ti­on sys­tem for in­ter­nal use there.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-4-4-p0">But Thomp­son &#x26; Rit­chie had their eye on a big­ger prize.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-5-1-p0">Tra­di­tio­nal­ly, ope­ra­ting sys­tems had been writ­ten in tight as­sem­bler to extract the ab­so­lu­te hig­hest ef­fi­ci­en­cy pos­si­ble out of their host ma­chi­nes.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-5-2-p0">Thomp­son and Rit­chie were among the first to rea­li­ze that hard­ware and com­pi­ler tech­no­lo­gy had be­co­me good en­ough that an ent­i­re ope­ra­ting sys­tem could be writ­ten in C, and by 1978 the whole en­vi­ron­ment had been suc­cess­ful­ly por­ted to se­veral ma­chi­nes of dif­fe­rent types.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-6-1-p0">This had never been done be­fo­re, and the im­pli­ca­ti­ons were enor­mous.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-6-2-p0">If Unix could pre­sent the same face, the same ca­pa­bi­li­ties, on ma­chi­nes of many dif­fe­rent types, it could serve as a com­mon soft­ware en­vi­ron­ment for all of them.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-6-3-p0">No lon­ger would users have to pay for com­ple­te new de­signs of soft­ware every time a ma­chi­ne went ob­so­le­te.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-6-4-p0">Ha­ckers could carry around soft­ware tool­kits bet­ween dif­fe­rent ma­chi­nes, ra­ther than ha­ving to re-in­vent the equi­va­l­ents of fire and the wheel every time.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-7-2-p0">Both were con­struc­ted from a „Keep It Sim­ple, Stu­pid“ phi­lo­so­phy.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-7-3-p0">A pro­gram­mer could ea­si­ly hold the ent­i­re lo­gi­cal struc­tu­re of C in his head (un­li­ke most other lan­gua­ges be­fo­re or since) ra­ther than nee­ding to refer con­stant­ly to ma­nu­als; and Unix was struc­tu­red as a fle­xi­ble tool­kit of sim­ple pro­grams de­si­gned to com­bi­ne with each other in use­ful ways.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-8-3-p0">By 1980 it had spre­ad to a large num­ber of uni­ver­si­ty and re­se­arch com­pu­ting sites, and thousands of ha­ckers con­side­red it home.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-9-2-p0">But be­cau­se of Unix's por­ta­bi­li­ty, it ran es­sen­ti­al­ly unal­te­red on a wider range of ma­chi­nes than one could find on the ent­i­re AR­PA­net.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-9-3-p0">And no­bo­dy used as­sem­bler; C pro­grams were rea­di­ly por­ta­ble among all these ma­chi­nes.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-10-1-p0">Unix even had its own net­wor­king, of sorts—UUCP: low-speed and un­re­lia­ble, but cheap.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-10-2-p0">Any two Unix ma­chi­nes could ex­ch­an­ge point-to-point elec­tro­nic mail over or­di­na­ry phone lines; this ca­pa­bi­li­ty was built into the sys­tem, not an op­tio­nal extra.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-10-3-p0">In 1980 the first Use­net sites began ex­ch­an­ging broad­cast news, for­ming a gi­gan­tic dis­tri­bu­ted bul­le­tin board that would quick­ly grow big­ger than AR­PA­net.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-11-2-p0">The PDP-10 and Unix/Use­net cul­tu­res began to meet and ming­le at the edges, but they didn't mix very well at first.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-11-3-p0">The PDP-10 ha­ckers ten­ded to con­sider the Unix crowd a bunch of up­starts, using tools that loo­ked ri­di­cu­lous­ly pri­mi­ti­ve when set against the ba­ro­que, lovely com­ple­xi­ties of LISP and ITS.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-12-2-p0">The first per­so­nal com­pu­ter had been mar­ke­ted in 1975; Apple was foun­ded in 1977, and ad­van­ces came with al­most un­be­lieva­ble ra­pi­di­ty in the years that fol­lo­wed.</span>
