        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-4-1-p0">In fact, I think Linus's cle­ve­r­est and most con­se­quen­ti­al hack was not the con­struc­tion of the Linux ker­nel its­elf, but ra­ther his in­ven­ti­on of the Linux de­ve­lop­ment model.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-4-2-p0">When I ex­pres­sed this opi­ni­on in his pre­sence once, he smi­led and quiet­ly re­pea­ted so­me­thing he has often said: "I'm ba­si­cal­ly a very lazy per­son who likes to get credit for things other peop­le ac­tual­ly do." Lazy like a fox.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-5-2-p0">In con­trast to the ca­the­dral-buil­ding style of the Emacs C core and most other GNU tools, the evo­lu­ti­on of the Lisp code pool was fluid and very user-dri­ven.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-5-3-p0">Ideas and pro­to­ty­pe modes were often re­writ­ten three or four times be­fo­re re­aching a sta­ble final form.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-6-1-p0">In­de­ed, my own most suc­cess­ful sin­gle hack pre­vious to fetchmail was pro­bab­ly Emacs VC (ver­si­on con­trol) mode, a Linux-like col­la­bo­ra­ti­on by email with three other peop­le, only one of whom (Ri­chard Stall­man, the aut­hor of Emacs and foun­der of the Free Soft­ware Foun­da­ti­on) I have met to this day.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-6-2-p0">It was a front-end for SCCS, RCS and later CVS from wi­t­hin Emacs that of­fe­red "one-touch" ver­si­on con­trol ope­ra­ti­ons.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-6-3-p0">It evol­ved from a tiny, crude sccs.el mode some­bo­dy else had writ­ten.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-7-3-p0">One such is MAT­LAB, a com­mer­ci­al data-ana­ly­sis and vi­sua­liza­t­i­on tool.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-3-7-4-p0">Users of MAT­LAB and other pro­ducts with a si­mi­lar struc­tu­re in­va­ria­bly re­port that the ac­tion, the fer­ment, the in­no­va­ti­on most­ly takes place in the open part of the tool where a large and va­ried com­mu­ni­ty can tin­ker with it.</span>
