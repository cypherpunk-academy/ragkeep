        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-27-1-p0">So far, con­ven­tio­nal de­ve­lop­ment ma­nage­ment looks like a bad bet now against open sour­ce on two points (re­sour­ce mar­shal­ling, or­ga­niza­t­i­on), and like it's li­ving on bor­ro­wed time with re­spect to a third (mo­ti­va­ti­on).</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-27-2-p0">And the poor be­le­ague­red con­ven­tio­nal ma­na­ger is not going to get any suc­cour from the mo­ni­to­ring issue; the stron­gest ar­gu­ment the open-sour­ce com­mu­ni­ty has is that de­cen­tra­li­zed peer re­view trumps all the con­ven­tio­nal me­thods for try­ing to en­su­re that de­tails don't get slip­ped.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-28-1-p0">Can we save de­fi­ning goals as a ju­s­ti­fi­ca­ti­on for the over­head of con­ven­tio­nal soft­ware pro­ject ma­nage­ment?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-28-2-p0">Per­haps; but to do so, we'll need good re­a­son to be­lie­ve that ma­nage­ment com­mit­tees and cor­po­ra­te road­maps are more suc­cess­ful at de­fi­ning worthy and wi­de­ly sha­red goals than the pro­ject lea­ders and tri­bal el­ders who fill the ana­lo­gous role in the open-sour­ce world.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-29-2-p0">And it's not so much the open-sour­ce side of the ba­lan­ce (the lon­ge­vi­ty of Emacs, or Linus Tor­valds's abili­ty to mo­bi­li­ze hor­des of de­ve­l­o­pers with talk of „world do­mi­na­ti­on“) that makes it tough.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-29-3-p0">Ra­ther, it's the de­mons­tra­ted aw­ful­ness of con­ven­tio­nal me­cha­nisms for de­fi­ning the goals of soft­ware pro­jects.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-30-1-p0">One of the best-known folk theo­rems of soft­ware en­gi­nee­ring is that 60% to 75% of con­ven­tio­nal soft­ware pro­jects eit­her are never com­ple­ted or are re­jec­ted by their in­ten­ded users.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-30-2-p0">If that range is anyw­he­re near true (and I've never met a ma­na­ger of any ex­pe­ri­ence who dis­pu­tes it) then more pro­jects than not are being aimed at goals that are eit­her (a) not rea­lis­ti­cal­ly at­tainable, or (b) just plain wrong.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-31-1-p0">This, more than any other pro­blem, is the re­a­son that in today's soft­ware en­gi­nee­ring world the very phra­se „ma­nage­ment com­mit­tee“ is li­kely to send chills down the hea­rer's spine—even (or per­haps es­pe­cial­ly) if the hea­rer is a ma­na­ger.</span>
