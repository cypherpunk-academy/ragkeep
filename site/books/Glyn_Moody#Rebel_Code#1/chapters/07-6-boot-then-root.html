        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-11-2-p0">He later wrote an ar­ti­cle for the first issue of the then-new Linux Jour­nal, dated May 1994, in which he said that SLS was “pos­si­bly the most bug-ridden and badly main­tai­ned Linux dis­tri­bu­ti­on avail­able; un­for­t­u­n­a­te­ly, it also quite pos­si­bly the most po­pu­lar.” These are ty­pi­cal young man’s words; Mur­dock was in his early twen­ties at the time.</span>
