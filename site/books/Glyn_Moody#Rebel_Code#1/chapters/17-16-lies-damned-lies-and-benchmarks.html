        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-1-2-p0">In early 1999, a spate of bench­mark tes­ting broke out as com­pu­ter ma­ga­zi­nes tried to es­ta­blish for the be­ne­fit of their re­a­ders how the two ope­ra­ting sys­tems com­pa­red in raw per­for­mance.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-20-3-p0">Then in April 1994, I got an e-mail from Syn­tax, the ma­kers of ‘To­tal­Net Ad­van­ced Ser­ver,’ a com­mer­ci­al SMB ser­ver.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-20-4-p0">They told me that they had a trade­mark on the name SMB­ser­ver and I would have to chan­ge the name.” So Tridgell loo­ked for words that con­tai­ned the let­ters S, M, and B and chose Samba as the best (ano­ther was “sal­mon­be­r­ry”).</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-100-2-p0">For ex­amp­le, at the be­gin­ning of 2000, Mi­cha­el Tie­mann, who be­ca­me Red Hat’s CTO after it ac­qui­red Cyg­nus, gave a cour­se on the GNU de­ve­lop­ment tools that Cyg­nus had por­ted to the IA-64, at a con­fe­rence for de­ve­l­o­pers on the new plat­form.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-100-5-p0">And what peop­le told me was they got up on stage on the first day of the con­fe­rence, they show­ed it boo­ting, they shut it down, and their ma­chi­ne went back into cold sto­r­a­ge.</span>
