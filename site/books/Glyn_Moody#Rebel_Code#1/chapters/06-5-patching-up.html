        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-1-2-p0">The ex­pla­na­ti­on is that Linux was born on the cusp of the cur­rent In­ter­net era, just as it moved out of aca­de­me into the main­stream; this is re­flec­ted by a com­ment An­d­rew Ta­nen­baum made du­ring the “Linux is ob­so­le­te” epi­so­de.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-1-3-p0">On the 3 Fe­bru­ary 1992 he wrote, “A point which I don’t think ever­yo­ne app­re­cia­tes is that ma­king so­me­thing avail­able by FTP is not ne­ces­sa­ri­ly the way to pro­vi­de the wi­dest dis­tri­bu­ti­on.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-5-2-p0">Three im­portant fea­tures were being added, but were avail­able only as patches at the time of wri­ting; these were a dri­ver for the Sound­Blas­ter sound­card, which made mul­ti­me­dia pos­si­ble under Linux; a way of rea­ding CD-ROMs, cru­ci­al­ly im­portant to ease the in­stal­la­ti­on of the gro­wing range of Linux soft­ware; and TCP/IP sup­port, which Linus said would be “in the next major re­lease, pro­bab­ly next week.” The next ker­nel re­lease was ver­si­on 0.98, which came out 29 Sep­tem­ber.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-10-2-p0">Cer­tain­ly, work on net­wor­king began around the same time that X Win­dow was being por­ted; and sur­pri­sin­gly, per­haps, the X Win­dow sys­tem and net­wor­king were in­ti­mate­ly re­la­ted.</span>
