        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-2-2-p0">In some ways, AR­PA­net was close to the In­ter­net; for ex­amp­le, it em­ploy­ed what is cal­led pa­cket-swit­ching whe­r­e­by data is bro­ken into small pa­ckets that are rou­ted over the net­work se­pa­ra­te­ly, and then re­as­sem­bled on their ar­ri­val.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-100-1-p0">Part­ly as a re­sult of this high­ly per­so­nal in­tel­lec­tu­al ap­proach that he has ad­op­ted in his spee­ches, Wall has made ano­ther im­portant cont­ri­bu­ti­on to the free soft­ware mo­ve­ment.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-100-2-p0">He of­fers an ex­amp­le of a top pro­gram­mer who is high­ly ar­ti­cu­la­te, witty, and de­eply con­cer­ned with the broa­der im­pli­ca­ti­ons of his work.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-100-3-p0">Soft-spo­ken and avun­cu­lar, Wall’s calm pre­sence at con­fe­ren­ces and be­fo­re the press has hel­ped to com­bat clichéd images of ha­ckers as un­sta­ble, an­ti­so­ci­al in­di­vi­du­als with litt­le sense of mo­ra­li­ty and no sense of humor.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-100-4-p0">If Ri­chard Stall­man is the fa­ther of today’s free soft­ware mo­ve­ment, Larry Wall can be right­ly con­side­red its fa­vo­ri­te uncle.</span>
