        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-1-2-p0">In part this pro­mo­ti­on was pro­bab­ly made in the ho­nest if ul­ti­mate­ly over-op­ti­mis­tic be­lief that the first “real” ver­si­on of Linux might be near (it was still two years away); it pro­bab­ly also re­flec­ted a psy­cho­lo­gi­cal need to em­pha­si­ze to the world, and maybe even to him­s­elf, the al­most-fi­nis­hed na­tu­re of the code.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-1-p0">Many Minix users re­mai­ned skep­ti­cal.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-2-p0">For ex­amp­le, when Tim Mur­phy, di­rec­tor of com­pu­ting at an Irish uni­ver­si­ty, had asked in comp.os.minix in Ja­nu­a­ry 1992 whe­ther “any in­de­pen­dent per­son [is] ac­tual­ly run­ning Linux, and can give an opi­ni­on on its me­rits vis-à-vis 386-Minix?” he went on to say, “It seems to me pret­ty un­li­kely on the face of it that an­yo­ne could re­al­ly write a re­lia­ble ope­ra­ting sys­tem from scratch in a short time.” Mur­phy now ex­plains, “I did think that Minix was be­au­ti­ful­ly writ­ten.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-3-p0">In fact, it was far bet­ter writ­ten, in my view, than Linux is today.”</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-3-2-p0">Ano­ther Minix user of the time, Derek Lie­ber, a sys­tems pro­gram­mer at a large com­pu­ter com­pa­ny, says he found the Minix code “cle­ar­ly writ­ten and or­ga­ni­zed into com­pre­hen­si­ble sub­sys­tems.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-3-3-p0">Of cour­se, Minix was writ­ten that way de­li­be­ra­te­ly,” he adds, “be­cau­se it was in­ten­ded as a tool for teaching.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-3-4-p0">Ass for the code qua­li­ty [of early Linux], I guess I thought it was me­di­o­cre.” But me­di­o­cre or not, he adds, “I was ama­zed that it worked.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-3-5-p0">I’d ex­pec­ted that I’d get it in­stal­led, watch it crash, and move on.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-4-2-p0">“But I could fit all of the [ker­nel], its sour­ce code, and the sour­ce code for all the GNU tools and still have 10 Mbyte for my own stuff; it was pro­gram­mer hea­ven.”</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-5-3-p0">For ex­amp­le, Ts’o had “made some heavy chan­ges even to 0.10,” as Linus put in one of his ex­ch­an­ges with Ta­nen­baum du­ring the “Linux is ob­so­le­te” fla­me­fest.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-5-4-p0">Si­mi­lar­ly, Eck­hardt re­mem­bers that he had “pul­led down” ver­si­on 0.10 and found that it didn’t work pro­per­ly.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-5-5-p0">“So I fi­gu­red out what would [work],” he says, and sent Linus a patch, or cor­rec­ted ver­si­on, of the part of the Linux sour­ce code that cau­sed the pro­blem.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-5-6-p0">Soon af­ter­wards, Linus “re­leased 0.11 and 0.12 with my chan­ges in­clu­ded,” Eck­hardt re­calls.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-8-2-p0">So that he could play this game while working on Linux he nee­ded to keep part of his hard disk for­mat­ted for MS-DOS.</span>
