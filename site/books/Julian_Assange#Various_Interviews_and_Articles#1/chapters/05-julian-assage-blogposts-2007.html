        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-2-p0">I once thought that the Truth was a set com­pri­sed of all the things that were true, and the big truth could be ob­tai­ned by ta­king all its com­po­nent pro­po­si­ti­ons and eva­lua­ting them until not­hing re­mai­ned.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-3-p0">I would ap­proach my rhe­to­ri­cal batt­les as a lo­gi­cal re­duc­tio­nist, tearing down, ato­mi­zing, pro­ving, dis­pro­ving, dis­car­ding fal­sehoods and re­as­sem­bling truths until the Truth was pure, gol­den and un­ar­guable.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-4-p0">But then, when truth mat­ters most, when truth is the agent of free­dom, I stood be­fo­re Jus­ti­ce and with truth, lost free­dom.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-5-p0">Here was so­me­thing fan­tas­ti­cal, un­be­lieva­ble and im­pos­si­ble, you could prove that (A => B) and (B => C) and (C => D) and (D => F) Jus­ti­ce would nod its head and agree, but then, when you tur­ned to claim your coup de grace, A => F ir­re­vo­c­a­b­ly, Jus­ti­ce would demur and re­vo­ke the axiom of tran­si­ti­vi­ty, for Jus­ti­ce will not be told when F stands for free­dom.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-6-p0">Tran­si­ti­vi­ty is evo­ked when Jus­ti­ce ima­gi­nes F and fin­ding the dream a plea­sura­ble one sets about gathe­ring cushions to prop up their slum­ber.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-7-p0">Here then is the truth about the Truth; the Truth is not bridge, stur­dy to every step, a mar­vel of bound planks and sup­ports from the known into the un­k­nown, but a sur­ging sea of smas­hed wood, flot­sam and drow­ning sailors.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-8-p0">So first, al­ways pick your poe­tic me­ta­phor, to make the re­a­der want to be­lie­ve, then the facts, and -- mi­ra­cle!</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-9-p0">-- tran­si­ti­vi­ty will de­scend from hea­ven, in­vo­ked as ju­s­ti­fi­ca­ti­on for pre­ju­di­ce.</span>
