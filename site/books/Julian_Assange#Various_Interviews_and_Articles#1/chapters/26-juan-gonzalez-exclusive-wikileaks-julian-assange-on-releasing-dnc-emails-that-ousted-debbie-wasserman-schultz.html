        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-18-4-p0">But ra­ther, what you get for each do­na­ti­on of a par­ti­cu­lar sort.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-18-5-p0">There’s even a phra­se used in one of the emails of, quote, “pay to play.” So, yeah, I think it’s ex­tre­me­ly in­te­res­ting.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-18-6-p0">There’s emails back and forth also bet­ween the Hil­la­ry Clin­ton cam­pai­gn and the DNC.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-18-7-p0">So, you see quite ela­bo­ra­te struc­tu­res of money being fun­ne­led to state De­mo­cra­tic Party of­fi­cers and then te­le­por­ted back, see­mingly to get up cer­tain stats, maybe to evade cer­tain cam­pai­gn fun­ding re­stric­tions.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-19-1-p0">In re­la­ti­on to what has be­co­me the most si­gni­fi­cant po­li­ti­cal dis­cus­sion as a re­sult of the pu­bli­ca­ti­on, which is that the DNC hig­her-ups, in­clu­ding Debbie Was­ser­man Schultz, were cle­ar­ly against Ber­nie San­ders and try­ing to sub­vert his cam­pai­gn in a whole raft of ways, that’s true.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-19-2-p0">That’s the—the at­mo­s­phe­re that is re­vea­led by hund­reds of emails is that it’s per­fect­ly ac­cep­ta­ble to pro­du­ce tren­chant in­ter­nal cri­ti­cisms of Ber­nie San­ders and dis­cuss ways to un­der­mi­ne his cam­pai­gn.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-19-3-p0">So, whe­ther that’s cal­ling up the pre­si­dent of MSNBC—Debbie Was­ser­man Schultz cal­led the pre­si­dent of MSNBC to haul Morning Joe into line, which it sub­se­quent­ly has done.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-19-4-p0">I no­ti­ced this morning, Morning Joe ac­tual­ly dis­cus­sed it them­sel­ves, try­ing to shore up their own pre­sen­ta­ti­on of, you know, a TV pro­gram that can’t be pus­hed around.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-19-5-p0">But, in fact, they did not men­ti­on the call to the pre­si­dent.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-19-6-p0">That was so­me­thing that is still un­spea­ka­ble.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-20-3-p0">There was an in­struc­tion by the head of com­mu­ni­ca­ti­ons, Luis Mi­ran­da, to take an anti-Ber­nie San­ders story, that had ap­peared in the press, and spre­ad that around wi­thout at­tri­bu­ti­on, not lea­ving their fin­ger­prints on it.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-20-6-p0">This was an in­struc­tion that was pus­hed to DNC staff to co­vert­ly get out into the media anti-Ber­nie San­ders sto­ries.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-24-1-p0">ROBBY MOOK: What’s dis­tur­bing to us is that ex­perts are tel­ling us that Rus­si­an state ac­tors broke into the DNC, stole these emails, and other ex­perts are now say­ing that the Rus­si­ans are re­leasing these emails for the pur­po­se of ac­tual­ly hel­ping Do­nald Trump.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-24-2-p0">I don’t think it’s co­in­ci­den­tal that these emails were re­leased on the eve of our con­ven­ti­on here.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-24-3-p0">We also saw last week at the Re­pu­bli­can con­ven­ti­on that Trump and his al­lies made chan­ges to the Re­pu­bli­can plat­form to make it more pro-Rus­si­an.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-24-4-p0">And we saw him tal­king about how NATO shouldn’t in­ter­vene to de­fend—or ne­ces­sa­ri­ly should in­ter­vene to de­fend our Eas­tern Eu­ro­pean al­lies if they’re at­ta­cked by Rus­sia.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-26-26-2-p0">Can you name them?” The an­s­wer was no, a re­fu­sal to name the ex­perts.</span>
