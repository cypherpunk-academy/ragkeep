        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-22-2-1-p0">Today the well-known whist­leb­lo­wer Brad­ley Man­ning has been or­de­red by a mi­li­ta­ry court in Ma­ry­land to spend a mi­ni­mum of 5.2 years in pri­son with a 32 year ma­xi­mum (in­clu­ding time al­re­a­dy spent in de­tenti­on), for re­vea­ling in­for­ma­ti­on about US go­vern­ment be­ha­viour to the pu­blic.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-22-3-2-p0">At the start of these pro­cee­dings, the United Sta­tes go­vern­ment had char­ged Brad­ley Man­ning with a ca­pi­tal of­fence and other char­ges car­ry­ing over 135 years of in­c­ar­ce­ra­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-22-3-3-p0">His de­fen­se team is now ap­pea­ling to the US Army Court of Cri­mi­nal Ap­peals in re­la­ti­on to this sen­tence and also for due pro­cess vio­la­ti­ons du­ring the trial.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-22-4-1-p0">While the de­fen­se should be proud of their tac­tical vic­to­ry, it should be re­mem­be­red that Mr Man­ning's trial and con­vic­tion is an af­front to basic con­cepts of Wes­tern jus­ti­ce.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-22-4-2-p0">On Mr Man­ning's ar­rest in May 2010, he was im­me­dia­te­ly sub­jec­ted to pu­ni­ti­ve in­c­ar­ce­ra­ti­on by the US go­vern­ment, which was found to be "cruel, in­hu­ma­ne and de­gra­ding" by the UN Spe­cial Rap­por­teur on Tor­tu­re, Juan Men­dez, and even found to be un­la­w­ful by US mi­li­ta­ry courts.</span>
