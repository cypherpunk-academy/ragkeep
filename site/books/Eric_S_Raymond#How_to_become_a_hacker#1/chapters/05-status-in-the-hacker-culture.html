        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-1-2-p0">You're try­ing to solve in­te­res­ting pro­blems, but how in­te­res­ting they are, and whe­ther your so­lu­ti­ons are re­al­ly good, is so­me­thing that only your tech­ni­cal peers or su­pe­ri­ors are nor­mal­ly equip­ped to judge.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-1-p0">Ac­cor­dingly, when you play the ha­cker game, you learn to keep score pri­ma­ri­ly by what other ha­ckers think of your skill (this is why you aren't re­al­ly a ha­cker until other ha­ckers con­sis­tent­ly call you one).</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-2-p0">This fact is ob­scu­red by the image of hacking as so­li­ta­ry work; also by a ha­cker-cul­tu­ral taboo (gra­dual­ly de­ca­ying since the late 1990s but still po­tent) against ad­mit­ting that ego or ex­ter­nal va­li­da­ti­on are in­vol­ved in one's mo­ti­va­ti­on at all.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-3-2-p0">You gain sta­tus and re­pu­ta­ti­on in it not by do­mi­na­ting other peop­le, nor by being be­au­ti­ful, nor by ha­ving things other peop­le want, but ra­ther by gi­ving things away.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-5-1-p0">The first (the most cen­tral and most tra­di­tio­nal) is to write pro­grams that other ha­ckers think are fun or use­ful, and give the pro­gram sour­ces away to the whole ha­cker cul­tu­re to use.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-8-1-p0">But there's a bit of a fine his­to­ri­cal point here.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-8-2-p0">While ha­ckers have al­ways loo­ked up to the open-sour­ce de­ve­l­o­pers among them as our com­mu­ni­ty's har­dest core, be­fo­re the mid-1990s most ha­ckers most of the time worked on clo­sed sour­ce.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-8-3-p0">This was still true when I wrote the first ver­si­on of this HOWTO in 1996; it took the main­strea­m­ing of open-sour­ce soft­ware after 1997 to chan­ge things.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-8-4-p0">Today, "the ha­cker com­mu­ni­ty" and "open-sour­ce de­ve­l­o­pers" are two de­scrip­ti­ons for what is es­sen­ti­al­ly the same cul­tu­re and po­pu­la­ti­on — but it is worth re­mem­be­ring that this was not al­ways so.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-8-5-p0">(For more on this, see the sec­tion cal­led "His­to­ri­cal Note: Hacking, Open Sour­ce, and Free Soft­ware".)</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-9-3-p0">That's why any open-sour­ce aut­hor who's thin­king will tell you that good beta-tes­ters (who know how to de­scri­be sym­ptoms cle­ar­ly, lo­ca­li­ze pro­blems well, can to­le­ra­te bugs in a qui­ckie re­lease, and are wil­ling to apply a few sim­ple dia­gnostic rou­ti­nes) are worth their weight in ru­bies.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-9-4-p0">Even one of these can make the dif­fe­rence bet­ween a de­bug­ging phase that's a protrac­ted, ex­haus­ting night­ma­re and one that's me­rely a sa­luta­ry nui­sance.</span>
