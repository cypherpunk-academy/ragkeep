        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-1-2-p0">It does help, howe­ver, and many ha­ckers are in fact nerds.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-1-3-p0">Being so­me­thing of a so­ci­al out­cast helps you stay con­cen­tra­ted on the re­al­ly im­portant things, like thin­king and hacking.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-2-1-p0">For this re­a­son, many ha­ckers have ad­op­ted the label 'geek' as a badge of pride — it's a way of de­cla­ring their in­de­pen­dence from nor­mal so­ci­al ex­pec­ta­ti­ons (as well as a fond­ness for other things like sci­ence fic­tion and stra­te­gy games that often go with being a ha­cker).</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-2-2-p0">The term 'nerd' used to be used this way back in the 1990s, back when 'nerd' was a mild pe­jo­ra­ti­ve and 'geek' a ra­ther har­s­her one; so­me­time after 2000 they swit­ched pla­ces, at least in U.S. po­pu­lar cul­tu­re, and there is now even a si­gni­fi­cant geek-pride cul­tu­re among peop­le who aren't te­chies.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-3-1-p0">If you can ma­na­ge to con­cen­tra­te en­ough on hacking to be good at it and still have a life, that's fine.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-3-2-p0">This is a lot ea­sier today than it was when I was a new­bie in the 1970s; main­stream cul­tu­re is much fri­end­lier to tech­no-nerds now.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-6-3-3-p0">There are even gro­wing num­bers of peop­le who rea­li­ze that ha­ckers are often high-qua­li­ty lover and spou­se ma­te­ri­al.</span>
