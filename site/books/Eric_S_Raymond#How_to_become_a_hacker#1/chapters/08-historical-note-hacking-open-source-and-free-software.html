        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-1-1-p0">When I ori­gi­nal­ly wrote this how-to in late 1996, some of the con­di­ti­ons around it were very dif­fe­rent from the way they look today.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-1-2-p0">A few words about these chan­ges may help cla­ri­fy mat­ters for peop­le who are con­fu­sed about the re­la­ti­ons­hip of open sour­ce, free soft­ware, and Linux to the ha­cker com­mu­ni­ty.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-2-1-p0">The ha­cker ethos and com­mu­ni­ty as I have de­scri­bed it here long pre­da­tes the emer­gence of Linux after 1990; I first be­ca­me in­vol­ved with it around 1976, and, its roots are rea­di­ly tra­ce­able back to the early 1960s. But be­fo­re Linux, most hacking was done on eit­her pro­prieta­ry ope­ra­ting sys­tems or a hand­ful of quasi-ex­pe­ri­men­tal ho­me­grown sys­tems like MIT's ITS that were never de­ploy­ed outs­ide of their ori­gi­nal aca­de­mic ni­ches.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-2-2-p0">While there had been some ear­lier (pre-Linux) at­tempts to chan­ge this si­tua­ti­on, their im­pact was at best very mar­gi­nal and con­fi­ned to com­mu­nities of de­di­ca­ted true be­lie­vers which were tiny mi­no­ri­ties even wi­t­hin the ha­cker com­mu­ni­ty, let alone with re­spect to the lar­ger world of soft­ware in ge­ne­ral.</span>

        <a class="p-num" href="#p-8-3">3|</a>
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-3-1-p0">What is now cal­led "open sour­ce" goes back as far as the ha­cker com­mu­ni­ty does, but until 1985 it was an un­named folk prac­tice ra­ther than a con­scious mo­ve­ment with theo­ries and ma­ni­fes­tos at­ta­ched to it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-3-2-p0">This preh­is­to­ry ended when, in 1985, arch-ha­cker Ri­chard Stall­man ("RMS") tried to give it a name — "free soft­ware".</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-3-3-p0">But his act of na­ming was also an act of clai­ming; he at­ta­ched ideo­lo­gi­cal bag­ga­ge to the "free soft­ware" label which much of the exis­ting ha­cker com­mu­ni­ty never ac­cep­ted.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-3-4-p0">Ass a re­sult, the "free soft­ware" label was loud­ly re­jec­ted by a sub­stan­ti­al mi­no­ri­ty of the ha­cker com­mu­ni­ty (es­pe­cial­ly among those as­so­cia­ted with BSD Unix), and used with se­rious but si­lent re­ser­va­tions by a ma­jo­ri­ty of the re­ma­in­der (in­clu­ding mys­elf).</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-1-p0">De­s­pi­te these re­ser­va­tions, RMS's claim to de­fi­ne and lead the ha­cker com­mu­ni­ty under the "free soft­ware" ban­ner broad­ly held until the mid-1990s. It was se­rious­ly chal­len­ged only by the rise of Linux.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-2-p0">Linux gave open-sour­ce de­ve­lop­ment a na­tu­ral home.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-3-p0">Many pro­jects is­sued under terms we would now call open-sour­ce mi­gra­ted from pro­prieta­ry Uni­xes to Linux.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-4-p0">The com­mu­ni­ty around Linux grew ex­plo­si­ve­ly, be­co­m­ing far lar­ger and more he­te­ro­ge­nous than the pre-Linux ha­cker cul­tu­re.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-5-p0">RMS de­ter­mi­ned­ly at­temp­ted to co-opt all this ac­tivi­ty into his "free soft­ware" mo­ve­ment, but was thwar­ted by both the ex­plo­ding di­ver­si­ty of the Linux com­mu­ni­ty and the pu­blic skep­ti­cism of its foun­der, Linus Tor­valds.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-6-p0">Tor­valds con­ti­nued to use the term "free soft­ware" for lack of any al­ter­na­ti­ve, but pu­bli­cly re­jec­ted RMS's ideo­lo­gi­cal bag­ga­ge.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-7-p0">Many youn­ger ha­ckers fol­lo­wed suit.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-5-1-p0">In 1996, when I first pu­blis­hed this Ha­cker HOWTO, the ha­cker com­mu­ni­ty was ra­pidly re­or­ga­ni­zing around Linux and a hand­ful of other open-sour­ce ope­ra­ting sys­tems (no­ta­b­ly those de­scen­ded from BSD Unix).</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-5-2-p0">Com­mu­ni­ty me­mo­ry of the fact that most of us had spent de­ca­des de­ve­lo­ping clo­sed-sour­ce soft­ware on clo­sed-sour­ce ope­ra­ting sys­tems had not yet begun to fade, but that fact was al­re­a­dy be­gin­ning to seem like part of a dead past; ha­ckers were, in­cre­a­sin­gly, de­fi­ning them­sel­ves as ha­ckers by their at­tach­ments to open-sour­ce pro­jects such as Linux or Apa­che.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-6-1-p0">The term "open sour­ce", howe­ver, had not yet emer­ged; it would not do so until early 1998.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-6-2-p0">When it did, most of the ha­cker com­mu­ni­ty ad­op­ted it wi­t­hin the fol­lo­wing six months; the ex­cep­ti­ons were a mi­no­ri­ty ideo­lo­gi­cal­ly at­ta­ched to the term "free soft­ware".</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-6-3-p0">Since 1998, and es­pe­cial­ly after about 2003, the iden­ti­fi­ca­ti­on of 'hacking' with 'open-sour­ce (and free soft­ware) de­ve­lop­ment' has be­co­me ex­tre­me­ly close.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-6-4-p0">Today there is litt­le point in at­temp­t­ing to dis­tin­gu­ish bet­ween these ca­te­go­ries, and it seems un­li­kely that will chan­ge in the fu­ture.</span>
