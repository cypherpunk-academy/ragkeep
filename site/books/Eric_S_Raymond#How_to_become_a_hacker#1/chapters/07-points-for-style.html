        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-1-3-p0">They're not sub­sti­tu­tes for hacking (not­hing is) but many ha­ckers do them, and feel that they con­nect in some basic way with the es­sence of hacking.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-1-p0"><ul>
<li>Learn to write your na­ti­ve lan­gua­ge well.</li>
</ul></span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-2-p0">Though it's a com­mon ste­reo­ty­pe that pro­gramm­ers can't write, a sur­pri­sing num­ber of ha­ckers (in­clu­ding all the most ac­com­plis­hed ones I know of) are very able wri­ters.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-3-p0"><ul>
<li>Read sci­ence fic­tion.</li>
</ul></span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-4-p0">Go to sci­ence fic­tion con­ven­ti­ons (a good way to meet ha­ckers and proto-ha­ckers).</span>

<li>Train in a mar­ti­al-arts form.</li>
</ul></span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-7-p0">The kind of men­tal di­sci­pli­ne re­qui­red for mar­ti­al arts seems to be si­mi­lar in im­portant ways to what ha­ckers do.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-8-p0">The most po­pu­lar forms among ha­ckers are de­fi­ni­te­ly Asian empty-hand arts such as Tae Kwon Do, va­rious forms of Ka­ra­te, Kung Fu, Ai­ki­do, or Ju Jitsu.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-9-p0">Wes­tern fen­cing and Asian sword arts also have vi­si­ble fol­lo­wings.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-10-p0">In pla­ces where it's legal, pis­tol shoo­ting has been ri­sing in po­pu­la­ri­ty since the late 1990s. The most ha­cker­ly mar­ti­al arts are those which em­pha­si­ze men­tal di­sci­pli­ne, re­la­xed awa­ren­ess, and pre­cise con­trol, ra­ther than raw strength, ath­le­ti­cism, or phy­si­cal tough­ness.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-11-p0"><ul>
<li>Study an ac­tu­al me­di­ta­ti­on di­sci­pli­ne.</li>
</ul></span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-12-p0">The pe­ren­ni­al fa­vo­ri­te among ha­ckers is Zen (im­port­ant­ly, it is pos­si­ble to be­ne­fit from Zen wi­thout ac­qui­ring a re­li­gi­on or dis­car­ding one you al­re­a­dy have).</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-13-p0">Other sty­les may work as well, but be ca­re­ful to choo­se one that doesn't re­qui­re you to be­lie­ve crazy things.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-14-p0"><ul>
<li>De­ve­lop an ana­ly­ti­cal ear for music.</li>
</ul></span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-2-15-p0">Learn to app­re­cia­te pe­cu­li­ar kinds of music.</span>

        <a class="p-num" href="#p-7-3">3|</a>
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-3-1-p0">The more of these things you al­re­a­dy do, the more li­kely it is that you are na­tu­ral ha­cker ma­te­ri­al.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-3-2-p0">Why these things in par­ti­cu­lar is not com­ple­te­ly clear, but they're con­nec­ted with a mix of left- and right-brain skills that seems to be im­portant; ha­ckers need to be able to both re­a­son lo­gi­cal­ly and step outs­ide the ap­pa­rent logic of a pro­blem at a mo­ment's no­ti­ce.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-4-2-p0">For true ha­ckers, the boun­da­ries bet­ween "play", "work", "sci­ence" and "art" all tend to disap­pe­ar, or to merge into a high-level crea­ti­ve play­ful­ness.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-4-3-p0">Also, don't be con­tent with a nar­row range of skills.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-4-4-p0">Though most ha­ckers self-de­scri­be as pro­gramm­ers, they are very li­kely to be more than com­pe­tent in se­veral re­la­ted skills — sys­tem ad­mi­nis­tra­ti­on, web de­sign, and PC hard­ware trou­ble­shoo­ting are com­mon ones.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-4-5-p0">A ha­cker who's a sys­tem ad­mi­nis­tra­tor, on the other hand, is li­kely to be quite skil­led at script pro­gramming and web de­sign.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-4-6-p0">Ha­ckers don't do things by hal­ves; if they in­vest in a skill at all, they tend to get very good at it.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-7-2-p0">Ha­ckers have long me­mo­ries — it could take you years to live your early blun­ders down en­ough to be ac­cep­ted.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-8-2-p0">Con­cea­ling your iden­ti­ty be­hind a hand­le is a ju­ve­ni­le and silly be­ha­vi­or cha­rac­te­ris­tic of cra­ckers, warez d00dz, and other lower life forms.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-8-3-p0">Ha­ckers don't do this; they're proud of what they do and want it as­so­cia­ted with their real names.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-7-8-4-p0">So if you have a hand­le, drop it.</span>
