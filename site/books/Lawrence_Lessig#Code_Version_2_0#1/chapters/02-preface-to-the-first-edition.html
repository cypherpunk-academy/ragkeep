        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-8-1-p0">In the spring of 1996, at an an­nu­al con­fe­rence or­ga­ni­zed under the title “Com­pu­ters, Free­dom, and Pri­va­cy” (CFP), two sci­ence-fic­tion wri­ters were in­vi­ted to tell sto­ries about cy­ber­space’s fu­ture.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-8-2-p0">Ver­nor Vinge spoke about “ubi­qui­tous law en­force­ment” made pos­si­ble by “fine-grai­ned dis­tri­bu­ted sys­tems,” in which the tech­no­lo­gy that will enable our fu­ture way of life also feeds data to, and ac­cepts com­man­ds from, the go­vern­ment.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-8-3-p0">The ar­chi­tec­tu­re that would enable this was al­re­a­dy being built—it was the In­ter­net—and tech­no­lo­gists were al­re­a­dy de­scri­bing ways in which it could be ex­ten­ded.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-8-4-p0">Ass this net­work which could allow such con­trol be­ca­me woven into every part of so­ci­al life, it would be just a mat­ter of time, Vinge said, be­fo­re the go­vern­ment clai­med con­trol over vital parts of this sys­tem.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-8-5-p0">Ass the sys­tem ma­tu­red, each new ge­ne­ra­ti­on of sys­tem code would in­crea­se the power of go­vern­ment.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-8-6-p0">Our di­gi­tal sel­ves—and in­cre­a­sin­gly, our phy­si­cal sel­ves—would live in a world of per­fect re­gu­la­ti­on, and the ar­chi­tec­tu­re of this dis­tri­bu­ted com­pu­ting—what we today call the In­ter­net and its suc­ces­sors—would make that re­gu­la­to­ry per­fec­tion pos­si­ble.</span>
