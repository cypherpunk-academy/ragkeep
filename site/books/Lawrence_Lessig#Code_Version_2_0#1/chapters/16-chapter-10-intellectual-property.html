        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-1-3-p0">Early into his se­cond year at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Chi­ca­go Law School, he came to me with an idea he had for a stu­dent “com­ment”—an ar­ti­cle that would be pu­blis­hed in the law re­view.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-1-4-p0">The topic was tre­spass law in cy­ber­space—whe­ther and how the law should pro­tect ow­ners of space in cy­ber­space from the kinds of in­tru­si­ons that tre­spass law pro­tects against in real space.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-1-5-p0">His in­iti­al idea was sim­ple: There should be no tre­spass law in cy­ber­space.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-1-6-p0">The law should grant “ow­ners” of space in cy­ber­space no legal pro­tec­tion against in­va­si­on; they should be forced to fend for them­sel­ves.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-3-1-p0">The idea—much more brief­ly and much less ele­gant­ly than Ree­ves has put it—is this: The ques­ti­on that law should ask is, What means would bring about the most ef­fi­ci­ent set of pro­tec­tions for pro­per­ty in­te­rests in cy­ber­space?</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-4-1-p0">Two sorts of pro­tec­tions are pos­si­ble.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-4-2-p0">One is the tra­di­tio­nal pro­tec­tion of law—the law de­fi­nes a space where others should not enter and pu­nis­hes peop­le who enter no­nethe­l­ess.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-4-3-p0">The other pro­tec­tion is a fence, a tech­no­lo­gi­cal de­vice (a bit of code) that (among other things) blocks the un­wan­ted from en­te­ring.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-4-4-p0">In real space, of cour­se, we have both—law, in the form of tre­spass law, and fen­ces that sup­ple­ment that law.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-4-5-p0">Both cost money, and the re­turn from each is not ne­ces­sa­ri­ly the same.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-4-6-p0">From a so­ci­al per­spec­tive, we would want the mix that pro­vi­des op­ti­mal pro­tec­tion at the lo­west cost.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-4-7-p0">(In eco­no­mics-speak, we would want a mix such that the mar­gi­nal cost of an ad­di­tio­nal unit of pro­tec­tion is equi­va­lent to the mar­gi­nal be­ne­fit.)</span>

      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-5-1-p0">The im­pli­ca­ti­on of this idea in real space is that it so­me­ti­mes makes sense to shift the bur­den of pro­tec­tion to ci­ti­zens ra­ther than to the state.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-5-2-p0">If, for ex­amp­le, a far­mer wants to store some va­luable seed on a re­mo­te part of his farm, it is bet­ter for him to bear the cost of fen­cing in the seed than to re­qui­re the po­li­ce to pa­trol the area more con­sis­tent­ly or to in­crea­se the pu­nish­ment for those they catch.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-5-3-p0">The ques­ti­on is al­ways one of ba­lan­ce bet­ween the costs and be­ne­fits of pri­va­te pro­tec­tion and state pro­tec­tion.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-6-2-p0">The op­ti­mal pro­tec­tion for spaces in cy­ber­space is a mix bet­ween pu­blic law and pri­va­te fen­ces.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-6-3-p0">The ques­ti­on to ask in de­ter­mi­ning the mix is which pro­tec­tion, on the mar­gin, costs less.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-6-4-p0">Ree­ves ar­gues that the costs of law in this con­text are ex­tre­me­ly high—in part be­cau­se of the costs of en­force­ment, but also be­cau­se it is hard for the law to dis­tin­gu­ish bet­ween le­gi­ti­ma­te and il­le­gi­ti­ma­te uses of cy­ber­spaces.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-6-5-p0">There are many “agents” that might “use” the space of cy­ber­space.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-6-6-p0">Web spi­ders, which gather data for web se­arch en­gi­nes; brow­sers, who are se­ar­ching across the Net for stuff to see; ha­ckers (of the good sort) who are tes­ting the locks of spaces to see that they are lo­cked; and ha­ckers (of the bad sort) who are brea­king and en­te­ring to steal.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-6-7-p0">It is hard, ex ante, for the law to know which agent is using the space le­gi­ti­mate­ly and which is not.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-19-1-p0">Du­ring the same pe­ri­od, norms about co­py­righ­ted con­tent also evol­ved.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-19-2-p0">But the sin­gle, de­fi­ning fea­ture of these norms can per­haps be sum­ma­ri­zed like this: that a con­su­mer could do with the co­py­righ­ted con­tent that he le­gal­ly owned any­thing he wan­ted to do, wi­thout ever trig­ge­ring the law of co­py­right.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-19-3-p0">This norm was true al­most by de­fi­ni­ti­on until 1909, since be­fo­re then, the law didn’t re­gu­la­te “co­pies.” Any use the con­su­mer made of co­py­righ­ted con­tent was the­re­fo­re high­ly un­li­kely to trig­ger any of the ex­clu­si­ve rights of co­py­right.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-19-4-p0">After 1909, though the law tech­ni­cal­ly re­gu­la­ted “co­pies,” the tech­no­lo­gies to make co­pies were broad­ly avail­able.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-19-5-p0">There was a strugg­le about Xerox ma­chi­nes, which forced a bit of re­form, but the first real con­flict that co­py­right law had with con­su­mers hap­pe­n­ed when cas­set­te tapes made it easy to copy re­cor­ded music.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-19-6-p0">Some of that co­py­ing was for the pur­po­se of ma­king a “mixed tape,” and some was sim­ply for the pur­po­se of avo­iding the need to buy the ori­gi­nal re­cor­ding.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-19-7-p0">After many years of de­ba­te, Con­gress de­ci­ded not to le­gis­la­te a ban on home ta­ping.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-19-9-p0">These chan­ges rein­forced the norm among con­su­mers that they were le­gal­ly free to do wha­te­ver they wan­ted with co­py­righ­ted work.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-19-10-p0">Given the tech­no­lo­gies most con­su­mers had ac­cess to, the stuff they wan­ted to do eit­her did not trig­ger co­py­right (e.g., re­sell their books to a used books­to­re), or if it did, the law was mo­di­fied to pro­tect it (e.g., cas­set­te tapes).</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-20-5-p0">The avail­a­bi­li­ty of co­pies was the­re­fo­re grea­ter.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-20-6-p0">Third, from the per­spec­tive of norms, con­su­mers who had in­ter­na­li­zed the norm that they could do with “their con­tent” wha­te­ver they wan­ted used these new di­gi­tal tools to make “their con­tent” avail­able wi­de­ly on the In­ter­net.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-20-7-p0">Com­pa­nies such as Naps­ter hel­ped fuel this be­ha­vi­or, but the prac­tice exis­ted both be­fo­re and after Naps­ter.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-20-8-p0">And fourth, from the per­spec­tive of law, be­cau­se the base tech­no­lo­gy of the In­ter­net didn’t re­veal any­thing about the na­tu­re of the con­tent being sha­red on the In­ter­net, or about who was doing the sharing, there was litt­le the law could do to stop this mas­si­ve “sharing” of con­tent.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-20-9-p0">Thus fifth, and from the per­spec­tive of co­py­right hol­ders, di­gi­tal tech­no­lo­gies and the In­ter­net were the per­fect storm for their busi­ness model: If they made money by con­trol­ling the dis­tri­bu­ti­on of “co­pies” of co­py­righ­ted con­tent, you could well un­der­stand why they view­ed the In­ter­net as a grave thre­at.</span>
