        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-72-1-p0">I have argued that we should un­der­stand the code in cy­ber­space to be its own sort of re­gu­la­to­ry re­gime, and that this code can so­me­ti­mes be in com­pe­ti­ti­on with the law’s re­gu­la­to­ry re­gime.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-72-2-p0">For ex­amp­le, we saw how co­py­right law could be in­con­sis­tent with the re­gu­la­to­ry re­gime of trusted sys­tems.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-72-3-p0">My ar­gu­ment is that we should un­der­stand these to be two re­gu­la­to­ry re­gimes in com­pe­ti­ti­on with each other.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-72-4-p0">We need a way to choo­se bet­ween them.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-72-5-p0">We need a way to de­ci­de which should pre­vail.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-73-1-p0">Ass this sys­tem of re­gu­la­ti­on by code de­ve­lops, it will con­tain its own norms, which it will ex­press in its struc­tu­res or in the rules it im­po­ses.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-73-2-p0">If the pre­dic­tions of law and eco­no­mics are cor­rect, these norms will no doubt be ef­fi­ci­ent, and they may well be just.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-73-3-p0">But to the extent that jus­ti­ce does not track ef­fi­ci­en­cy, they will be ef­fi­ci­ent and un­just.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-74-1-p0">There is an im­portant pat­tern in this com­pe­ti­ti­on bet­ween code and law.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-74-2-p0">Law, at least as it re­gu­la­tes in­ter­na­tio­nal re­la­ti­ons, is the pro­duct of ex­ten­ded ne­go­tia­ti­ons.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-74-3-p0">Coun­tries must come to an agree­ment about how law will re­gu­la­te and about any norms that they will im­po­se on pri­va­te or­de­ring.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-74-4-p0">Ass their work re­la­tes to cy­ber­space in par­ti­cu­lar, this agree­ment is quite si­gni­fi­cant.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-74-5-p0">It will re­qui­re the na­ti­ons of the world to come to a com­mon un­der­stan­ding about this space and to de­ve­lop a com­mon stra­te­gy for dea­ling with its re­gu­la­ti­on.</span>
