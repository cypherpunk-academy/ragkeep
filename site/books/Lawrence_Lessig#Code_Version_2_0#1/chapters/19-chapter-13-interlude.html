      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-1-p0">LET’S PAUSE FOR A MO­MENT AND LOOK BACK OVER THESE THREE CHAP­TERS.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-2-p0">THERE is a pat­tern to the pro­blems they pre­sent—a way of un­der­stan­ding how all three pro­blems are the same.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-3-p0">In one sense, each has asked: How much con­trol should we allow over in­for­ma­ti­on, and by whom should this con­trol be ex­er­cised?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-4-p0">There is a batt­le bet­ween code that pro­tects in­tel­lec­tu­al pro­per­ty and fair use; there is a batt­le bet­ween code that might make a mar­ket for pri­va­cy and the right to re­port facts about in­di­vi­du­als re­gard­less of that mar­ket; there is a batt­le bet­ween code that enables per­fect fil­te­ring of speech and ar­chi­tec­tu­res that en­su­re some mes­si­ness about who gets what.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-5-p0">Each case calls for a ba­lan­ce of con­trol.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-6-p0">My vote in each con­text may seem to vary.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-7-p0">With re­spect to in­tel­lec­tu­al pro­per­ty, I argue against code that tracks rea­ding and in favor of code that gua­ran­tees a large space for an in­tel­lec­tu­al com­mons.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-8-p0">In the con­text of pri­va­cy, I argue in favor of code that enables in­di­vi­du­al choice—both to en­crypt and to ex­press pre­fe­ren­ces about what per­so­nal data is collec­ted by others.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-9-p0">Code would enable that choice; law could in­spi­re that code.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-10-p0">In the con­text of free speech, howe­ver, I argue against code that would per­fect­ly fil­ter speech— it is too dan­ge­rous, I claim, to allow per­fect choice there.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-11-p0">Bet­ter choice, of cour­se, is bet­ter, so code that would em­power bet­ter sys­tems of re­pu­ta­ti­on is good, as is code that would widen the le­gi­ti­ma­te range of broad­cas­ting.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-12-p0">The aim in all three con­texts is to work against cen­tra­li­zed struc­tu­res of choice.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-13-p0">In the con­text of fil­te­ring, howe­ver, the aim is to work against struc­tu­res that are too in­di­vi­dua­li­zed as well.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-14-p0">You may ask whe­ther these choices are con­sis­tent.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-15-p0">I think they are, but it’s not im­portant that you agree.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-16-p0">You may be­lie­ve that a dif­fe­rent ba­lan­ce makes sense—more con­trol for in­tel­lec­tu­al pro­per­ty or fil­te­ring per­haps, and less for pri­va­cy.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-17-p0">My real in­te­rest is in con­vey­ing the ne­ces­si­ty of such ba­lan­cing and of the va­lues im­pli­cit in the claim that we will al­ways re­qui­re a ba­lan­ce.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-18-p0">Al­ways there is a com­pe­ti­ti­on bet­ween the pu­blic and pri­va­te; al­ways the rights of the pri­va­te must be ba­lan­ced against the in­te­rests of the pu­blic.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-19-p0">Al­ways a choice must be made about how far each side will be al­lo­wed to reach.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-20-p0">These ques­ti­ons are in­herent to pu­blic law: How will a par­ti­cu­lar con­stel­la­ti­on of con­sti­tu­tio­nal va­lues be recko­ned?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-21-p0">How will a ba­lan­ce be struck in par­ti­cu­lar fac­tu­al con­texts?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-22-p0">I have argued this point while ne­glec­ting to spe­ci­fy who is re­s­pon­si­ble for any given im­ba­lan­ce.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-23-p0">There are those who would say that there is too much fil­te­ring, or not en­ough pri­va­cy, or too much con­trol over in­tel­lec­tu­al pro­per­ty, but these are not pu­blic con­cerns un­less the go­vern­ment is re­s­pon­si­ble for these im­ba­lan­ces.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-24-p0">Con­sti­tu­tio­nal value in the United Sta­tes ex­tends only so far as state ac­tion ex­tends.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-25-p0">And I have not shown just how state ac­tion ex­tends to these con­texts.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-26-p0">I do not in­tend to.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-27-p0">In my view, our tra­di­ti­on re­veals at least an am­bi­gui­ty about how far con­sti­tu­tio­nal va­lues are to ex­tend.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-28-p0">In a world where only go­vern­ments are re­gu­la­tors, ke­eping the Con­sti­tu­ti­on’s aut­ho­ri­ty li­mi­ted to state ac­tion makes some sense.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-29-p0">But when the mo­da­li­ties of re­gu­la­ti­on are mul­ti­plied, there is no re­a­son to igno­re the reach of con­sti­tu­tio­nal va­lues.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-30-p0">Our framers made no choice about this; there is no re­a­son why re­gu­la­ti­on through code can­not be in­for­med by con­sti­tu­tio­nal va­lues.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-31-p0">No ar­gu­ment has been made for why this part of our life should be cut off from the li­mi­ta­ti­ons and pro­tec­tions tra­di­tio­nal­ly pro­vi­ded by the Con­sti­tu­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-32-p0">Code strikes the ba­lan­ce bet­ween in­di­vi­du­al and collec­tive rights that I have high­ligh­ted so far.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-33-p0">In the next chap­ter, a dif­fe­rent ba­lan­ce is struck—one again made sa­li­ent by code.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-34-p0">Howe­ver, this time the ba­lan­ce is not bet­ween the state and the in­di­vi­du­al but bet­ween the state and the im­pli­cit re­gu­la­ti­ons of the ar­chi­tec­tu­res of cy­ber­space.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-35-p0">Now the thre­at is to a tra­di­tio­nal sover­eig­n­ty.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-19-1-36-p0">How do we trans­la­te that tra­di­ti­on to fit a world where code is law?</span>
