        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-25-7-2-p0">But the Court should no­nethe­l­ess pro­ceed to re­sol­ve it in the way most li­kely to in­du­ce de­mo­cra­tic re­view of the re­so­lu­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-25-7-3-p0">If the re­so­lu­ti­on in­du­ces the pro­per re­view, the Court should let stand the re­sults of that re­view.</span>
