        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-1-1-p0">AT THE HEIGHT OF A PRE­VIOUS WAR ON DRUGS—PRO­HI­BI­TI­ON, IN THE LATE 1920s—the fe­deral go­vern­ment began using a tech­ni­que of po­li­ce work that start­led many but pro­ved quite ef­fec­tive: wir­e­tap­ping.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-1-2-p0">Life had just begun to move onto the wires, and, in an ef­fort to take ad­van­ta­ge of the evi­dence that this new me­di­um might yield, the go­vern­ment began to tap pho­nes wi­thout war­rants.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-3-2-p0">The go­vern­ment was in­ves­ti­ga­ting one of the lar­gest il­le­gal li­quor im­port, dis­tri­bu­ti­on, and sales or­ga­niza­t­i­ons in the na­ti­on.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-4-1-p0">Using these taps, the go­vern­ment re­cor­ded many hours of con­ver­sa­ti­ons (775 ty­pewrit­ten pages, ac­cor­ding to Jus­ti­ce Louis Brand­eis), and it used these re­cor­dings to con­vict the de­fen­dants in the case.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-4-2-p0">The de­fen­dants chal­len­ged the use of these re­cor­dings, clai­ming that the go­vern­ment had vio­la­ted the Con­sti­tu­ti­on in se­cu­ring them.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-4-3-p0">The Fourth Amend­ment pro­tects “per­sons, hou­ses, pa­pers, and ef­fects, against un­re­a­sonable se­ar­ches and sei­zu­res,” and this wir­e­tap­ping, the de­fen­dants argued, was a vio­la­ti­on of their right to be pro­tec­ted from un­re­a­sonable se­ar­ches.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-5-1-p0">Under then-exis­ting law, it was plain that to enter the apart­ments of al­le­ged boot­leg­ger Roy Olm­stead and his as­so­cia­tes and se­arch them (at least while they were gone), the go­vern­ment in­ves­ti­ga­tors would have nee­ded a war­rant, that is, they would have nee­ded the ap­pro­val of a judge or ma­gis­tra­te be­fo­re in­va­ding the de­fen­dants’ pri­va­cy.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-5-2-p0">This is what the Fourth Amend­ment had come to mean—that cer­tain pla­ces (per­sons, hou­ses, pa­pers, and ef­fects) were pro­tec­ted by pres­ump­tive­ly re­qui­ring a war­rant be­fo­re they could be in­va­ded.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-5-3-p0">Here there had been no war­rant, and hence, as the de­fen­dants argued, the se­arch had been il­le­gal.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-6-1-p0">We might pause to ask why.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-6-2-p0">If we read the text of the Fourth Amend­ment ca­re­ful­ly, it is hard to see just where a war­rant is re­qui­red: (a) The right of the peop­le to be se­cu­re in their per­sons, hou­ses, pa­pers, and ef­fects, against un­re­a­sonable se­ar­ches and sei­zu­res, shall not be vio­la­ted, and (b) no War­rants shall issue, but upon pro­bable cause, sup­por­ted by Oath or af­fir­ma­ti­on, and par­ti­cu­lar­ly de­scri­bing the place to be se­ar­ched, and the per­sons or things to be sei­zed.</span>

      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-7-1-p0">The Fourth Amend­ment is re­al­ly two com­man­ds.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-7-2-p0">(I’ve added “a” and “b” to help make the point.) The first says that a cer­tain right (“the right of the Peop­le to be se­cu­re”) shall not be vio­la­ted; the se­cond li­mits the con­di­ti­ons under which a war­rant shall be is­sued.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-7-3-p0">But the text of the amend­ment does not state a re­la­ti­ons­hip bet­ween the first part and the se­cond part.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-7-4-p0">And it cer­tain­ly does not say that a se­arch is un­re­a­sonable if it is not sup­por­ted by a war­rant.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-7-5-p0">So why the “war­rant re­qui­re­ment”?</span>

      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-8-1-p0">To make sense of the amend­ment, we must go back to its framing.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-8-2-p0">At that time, the legal pro­tec­tion against the in­va­si­on of pri­va­cy was tre­spass law.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-8-3-p0">If so­meo­ne en­t­e­red your pro­per­ty and rif­led through your stuff, that per­son vio­la­ted your com­mon law rights against tre­spass.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-8-4-p0">You could sue that per­son for tre­spass, whe­ther he was a po­li­ce of­fi­cer or pri­va­te ci­ti­zen.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-8-5-p0">The thre­at of such suits gave the po­li­ce an in­cen­ti­ve not to in­va­de your pri­va­cy.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-9-2-p0">These boil down to whe­ther the se­arch was “re­a­sonable.” But there were two im­portant facts about this re­a­sona­blen­ess.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-9-3-p0">First, the de­ter­mi­na­ti­on of re­a­sona­blen­ess was made by a jury.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-9-4-p0">Neigh­bors and peers of the of­fi­cer jud­ged whe­ther his be­ha­vi­or had been pro­per.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-9-5-p0">Se­cond, in some cases re­a­sona­blen­ess was found as a mat­ter of law—that is, the judge would in­struct the jury to find that the se­arch had been re­a­sonable.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-9-6-p0">(For ex­amp­le, when the of­fi­cer found con­tra­band on the pro­per­ty of the de­fen­dant, whe­ther there was suf­fi­ci­ent sus­pi­ci­on be­fo­re the se­arch or not, the se­arch was re­a­sonable.)</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-61-4-p0">Ass I argue in more de­tail in Part IV, given the cur­rent at­ti­tu­des of our courts, and our legal cul­tu­re ge­ne­ral­ly, con­sti­tu­tio­nal choices are cost­ly.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-62-2-p0">One re­s­pon­se is pas­si­ve: The court sim­ply lets the le­gis­la­tu­re de­ci­de.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-63-1-p0">The se­cond re­s­pon­se is more ac­tive: The court finds a way to ar­ti­cu­la­te con­sti­tu­tio­nal va­lues that were not pre­sent at the foun­ding.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-63-2-p0">The courts help spur a con­ver­sa­ti­on about these fun­da­men­tal va­lues—or at least add their voice to this con­ver­sa­ti­on—to focus a de­ba­te that may ul­ti­mate­ly be re­sol­ved el­sew­he­re.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-63-3-p0">The first re­s­pon­se is a way of doing not­hing; the se­cond is a way of ex­cit­ing a dia­lo­gue about con­sti­tu­tio­nal va­lues as a means to con­fron­ting and re­sol­ving new ques­ti­ons.^^30^^</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-64-2-p0">My sense is that they will step back be­cau­se they feel (as the ba­lan­ce of this book ar­gues) that these are new ques­ti­ons that cy­ber­space has rai­sed.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-64-3-p0">Their new­ness will make them feel po­li­ti­cal, and when a ques­ti­on feels po­li­ti­cal, courts step away from re­sol­ving it.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-15-65-2-p0">The phi­lo­so­pher Ber­nard Wil­li­ams has argued that be­cau­se the Su­pre­me Court has taken so cen­tral a role in the ar­ti­cu­la­ti­on of con­sti­tu­tio­nal va­lues, le­gis­la­tu­res no lon­ger do.^^31^^ Whe­ther Wil­li­ams is cor­rect or not, this much is clear: The con­sti­tu­tio­nal dis­cour­se of our pre­sent Con­gress is far below the level at which it must be to ad­dress the ques­ti­ons about con­sti­tu­tio­nal va­lues that will be rai­sed by cy­ber­space.</span>
