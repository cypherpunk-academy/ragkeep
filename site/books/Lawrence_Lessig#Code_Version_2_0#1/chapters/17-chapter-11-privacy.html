        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-2-2-p0">In­de­ed, as Jo­na­than Zit­train argued in an essay pu­blis­hed in the Stan­ford Law Re­view, the pro­blems of pri­va­cy and co­py­right are ex­act­ly the same.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-2-3-p0">With both, there’s a bit of “our” data that “we’ve” lost con­trol over.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-2-4-p0">In the case of co­py­right, it is the data con­sti­tu­ting a copy of our co­py­righ­ted work; in the case of pri­va­cy, it is the data re­pre­sen­ting some fact about us.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-2-5-p0">In both cases, the In­ter­net has pro­du­ced this loss of con­trol: with co­py­right, be­cau­se the tech­no­lo­gy enables per­fect and free co­pies of con­tent; with pri­va­cy, as we’ll see in this chap­ter, be­cau­se the tech­no­lo­gy enables per­pe­tu­al and cheap mo­ni­to­ring of be­ha­vi­or.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-2-6-p0">In both cases, the ques­ti­on po­li­cy ma­kers should ask is what mix of law and tech­no­lo­gy might res­to­re the pro­per level of con­trol.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-2-7-p0">That level must ba­lan­ce pri­va­te and pu­blic in­te­rests: With co­py­right, the ba­lan­ce is as I de­scri­bed in the last chap­ter; with pri­va­cy, it is as we’ll ex­plo­re in this chap­ter.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-3-5-p0">The re­sult of these dif­fe­ren­ces, as any po­li­ti­cal theo­rist would then pre­dict, is that over the past ten years, while we’ve seen a lot of le­gis­la­ti­ve and tech­ni­cal chan­ges to solve the pro­blems fa­c­ing co­py­right, we’ve seen very few that would solve the pro­blems of pri­va­cy.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-58-5-p0">So the ma­chi­ne would spit out bits of data im­pli­ca­ting X in some tar­ge­ted crime, and a court would de­ci­de whe­ther that data suf­ficed eit­her to ju­s­ti­fy an ar­rest or a more tra­di­tio­nal se­arch.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-58-6-p0">And fi­nal­ly, to make the sys­tem as pro­tec­tive as we can, the only evi­dence that could be used from this sur­veil­lan­ce would be evi­dence di­rec­ted against the cri­mes being sur­veil­led for.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-17-58-7-p0">So for ex­amp­le, if you’re loo­king for ter­ro­rists, you don’t use the evi­dence to pro­se­cu­te for tax eva­si­on.</span>
