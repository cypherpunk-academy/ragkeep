        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-18-1-2-p0">IT IS NOT THE right to free ac­cess to te­le­vi­si­on, or the right that peop­le will not hate you for what you have to say.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-18-1-3-p0">Strict­ly spea­king—le­gal­ly spea­king—the right to free speech in the United Sta­tes means the right to be free from pu­nish­ment by the go­vern­ment in re­ta­lia­ti­on for at least some (pro­bab­ly most) speech.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-18-1-4-p0">You can­not be jai­led for cri­ti­ci­zing the Pre­si­dent, though you can be jai­led for threa­ten­ing him; you can­not be fined for pro­mo­ting se­gre­ga­ti­on, though you will be shun­ned if you do.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-18-1-5-p0">You can­not be stop­ped from spea­king in a pu­blic place, though you can be stop­ped from spea­king with an FM trans­mit­ter.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-18-1-6-p0">Speech in the United Sta­tes is pro­tec­ted—in a com­plex, and at times con­vo­lu­ted, way— but its con­sti­tu­tio­nal pro­tec­tion is a pro­tec­tion against the go­vern­ment.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-18-2-2-p0">Two so­cie­ties could have the same “First Amend­ment”—the same pro­tec­tions against go­vern­ment’s wrath—but if wi­t­hin one dis­sen­ters are to­le­ra­ted while in the other they are shun­ned, the two so­cie­ties would be very dif­fe­rent free-speech so­cie­ties.</span>
