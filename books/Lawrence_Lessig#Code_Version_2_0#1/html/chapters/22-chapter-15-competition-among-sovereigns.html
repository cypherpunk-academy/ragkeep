        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-22-98-2-p0">Ass I’ve al­re­a­dy de­scri­bed, in Ja­nu­a­ry 2005, Goog­le an­noun­ced that it was gi­ving so­me­thing to the Chi­ne­se go­vern­ment it has re­fu­sed to give an­yo­ne else in the world—a ver­si­on of the Goog­le se­arch en­gi­ne that blocks con­tent the Chi­ne­se go­vern­ment doesn’t want its ci­ti­zens to see.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-22-98-3-p0">Thus, if you se­arch on “de­mo­cra­cy” or “human rights” on Goog­le.cn, you wouldn’t find what you’ll find if you se­arch in the same way on Goog­le.com.</span>
