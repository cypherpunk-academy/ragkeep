        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-1-1-p0">The les­son of the last part was that the in­ter­ac­tion bet­ween com­mer­ce and go­vern­ment will chan­ge the ef­fec­tive ar­chi­tec­tu­re of the In­ter­net.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-1-2-p0">That chan­ge will in­crea­se the re­gu­la­bi­li­ty of be­ha­vi­or on the In­ter­net.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-1-3-p0">Pow­der will be spray­ed on the in­vi­si­ble men of cy­ber­space, and after the spray, their ex­ploits will be more ea­si­ly known.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-2-1-p0">But so far my story has not chan­ged the basic mode by which go­vern­ment re­gu­la­tes.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-2-2-p0">So far, the go­vern­ment threa­tens pu­nish­ment, and that thre­at is in­ten­ded to crea­te the in­cen­ti­ve for in­di­vi­du­als to obey the go­vern­ment’s rule.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-2-3-p0">The chan­ges in the ef­fec­tive ar­chi­tec­tu­re of cy­ber­space that I have de­scri­bed would sim­ply make it ea­sier for the state to make good on its thre­at, and that would re­du­ce the ex­pec­ted value of cri­mi­nal be­ha­vi­or (pre­fe­r­a­b­ly below zero).</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-2-4-p0">Tra­ce­a­bi­li­ty will in­crea­se ef­fec­tive en­force­ment; ef­fec­tive en­force­ment will in­crea­se the costs of de­via­ting from a state-spe­ci­fied rule.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-3-1-p0">In this part, I con­sider a dif­fe­rent kind of re­gu­la­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-3-2-p0">The ques­ti­on here is not how the ar­chi­tec­tu­re of the Net will make it ea­sier for tra­di­tio­nal re­gu­la­ti­on to hap­pen.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-3-3-p0">The issue here is how the ar­chi­tec­tu­re of the Net—or its “code”—its­elf be­co­mes a re­gu­la­tor.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-3-4-p0">In this con­text, the rule ap­p­lied to an in­di­vi­du­al does not find its force from the thre­at of con­se­quen­ces en­forced by the law—fines, jail, or even shame.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-3-5-p0">Ins­tead, the rule is ap­p­lied to an in­di­vi­du­al through a kind of phy­sics.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-3-6-p0">A lo­cked door is not a com­mand “do not enter” ba­cked up with the thre­at of pu­nish­ment by the state.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-3-7-p0">A lo­cked door is a phy­si­cal cons­traint on the li­ber­ty of so­meo­ne to enter some space.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-4-1-p0">My claim is that this form of re­gu­la­ti­on will be­co­me in­cre­a­sin­gly com­mon in cy­ber­space.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-4-2-p0">And it has, mo­re­o­ver, a dis­tinc­tive and often coun­ter­in­tui­ti­ve cha­rac­ter.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-4-3-p0">The aim of this part is to ex­plo­re this dis­tinc­tive mode of re­gu­la­ti­on as a step to un­der­stan­ding more sys­te­ma­ti­cal­ly the in­ter­ac­tion bet­ween tech­no­lo­gy and po­li­cy.</span>
