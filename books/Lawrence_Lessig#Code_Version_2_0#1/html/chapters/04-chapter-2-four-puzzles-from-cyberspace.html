        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-33-1-p0">We’re a short way into this not so short book, though what I’m about to say may make it a very short book in­de­ed (for you at least).</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-33-2-p0">This book is all about the ques­ti­on rai­sed by this sim­ple story, and about any sim­pli­ci­ty in this ap­pa­r­ent­ly sim­ple an­s­wer.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-33-3-p0">This is not a book about MMOG space or ava­tars.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-33-4-p0">The story about Mar­tha and Dank is the first and last ex­amp­le that will in­clu­de ava­tars.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-33-5-p0">But it is a book about cy­ber­space.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-33-6-p0">My claim is that both “on the In­ter­net” and “in cy­ber­space,” we will con­front pre­cise­ly the ques­ti­ons that Mar­tha and Dank faced, as well as the ques­ti­ons that their so­lu­ti­on rai­sed.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-33-7-p0">Both “on the In­ter­net” and “in cy­ber­space,” tech­no­lo­gy con­sti­tu­tes the en­vi­ron­ment of the space, and it will give us a much wider range of con­trol over how in­ter­ac­tions work in that space than in real space.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-33-8-p0">Pro­blems can be pro­gram­med or “coded” into the story, and they can be “coded” away.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-33-9-p0">And while the ex­pe­ri­ence with ga­mers so far is that they don’t want vir­tu­al worlds to de­via­te too far from the real, the im­portant point for now is that there is the ca­pa­ci­ty to make these worlds dif­fe­rent.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-33-10-p0">It is this ca­pa­ci­ty that rai­ses the ques­ti­on that is at the core of this book: What does it mean to live in a world where pro­blems can be coded away?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-33-11-p0">And when, in that world, should we code pro­blems away, ra­ther than learn to work them out, or pu­nish those who cause them?</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-103-1-p0">These four the­mes frame ever­y­thing that fol­lows.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-103-2-p0">They also map the un­der­stan­ding that I want this book to pro­vi­de.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-103-3-p0">Re­gu­la­ti­on in cy­ber­space can help us see so­me­thing im­portant about how all re­gu­la­ti­on works.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-103-4-p0">That’s the les­son of the first theme, “re­gu­la­bi­li­ty.” It will also in­tro­du­ce a re­gu­la­tor (“code”) whose si­gni­fi­can­ce we don’t yet fully un­der­stand.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-103-5-p0">That’s the se­cond theme, “Re­gu­la­ti­on by Code.” That re­gu­la­ti­on will ren­der am­bi­guous cer­tain va­lues that are fun­da­men­tal to our tra­di­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-103-6-p0">Thus, the third theme, “la­tent am­bi­gui­ty.” That am­bi­gui­ty will re­qui­re us, the United Sta­tes, to make a choice.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-103-7-p0">But this choice is just one among many that many sover­eigns will have to make.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-103-8-p0">In the end the har­dest pro­blem will be to reckon these “com­pe­ting sover­eigns,” as they each act to mark this space with their own dis­tinc­tive va­lues.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-104-1-p0">I ex­plo­re these four the­mes against a back­ground that, as I said at the start, has chan­ged si­gni­fi­cant­ly since the first edi­ti­on of this book.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-104-2-p0">When I first wrote the book, two ideas see­med to do­mi­na­te de­ba­te about the Net: first, that the go­vern­ment could never re­gu­la­te the Net, and se­cond, that this was a good thing.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-104-3-p0">Today, at­ti­tu­des are dif­fe­rent.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-104-4-p0">There is still the com­mon­place that go­vern­ment can’t re­gu­la­te, but in a world drow­ning in spam, com­pu­ter vi­ru­s­es, iden­ti­ty theft, co­py­right “pi­ra­cy,” and the se­xu­al ex­ploi­ta­ti­on of child­ren, the re­sol­ve against re­gu­la­ti­on has wea­k­e­ned.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-104-5-p0">We all love the Net.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-104-6-p0">But if some go­vern­ment could re­al­ly de­li­ver on the pro­mi­se to erase all the bads of this space, most of us would gl­ad­ly sign up.</span>

      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-105-1-p0">Yet while at­ti­tu­des about the Net have pro­gres­sed, my own views have not.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-105-2-p0">I still be­lie­ve the Net can be re­gu­la­ted.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-105-3-p0">I still be­lie­ve that the ob­vious con­se­quence of ob­vious in­flu­en­ces will be to ra­di­cal­ly in­crea­se the abili­ty of go­vern­ments to re­gu­la­te this Net.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-105-4-p0">I also still be­lie­ve that, in prin­ciple, this is not a bad thing.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-105-5-p0">I am not against re­gu­la­ti­on, pro­per­ly done.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-105-6-p0">I be­lie­ve re­gu­la­ti­on is es­sen­ti­al to pre­ser­ving and de­fen­ding cer­tain fun­da­men­tal li­ber­ties.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-105-7-p0">But I also still be­lie­ve that we are far from a time when our go­vern­ment in par­ti­cu­lar can pro­per­ly re­gu­la­te in this con­text.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-105-8-p0">This is both be­cau­se of a ge­ne­ral skep­ti­cism about go­vern­ment—groun­ded in a dis­gust about the par­ti­cu­lar form of cor­rup­ti­on that de­fi­nes how our go­vern­ment func­tions—and a par­ti­cu­lar skep­ti­cism about go­vern­ment—that it has not yet fully re­co­gni­zed just how re­gu­la­ti­on in the di­gi­tal age works.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-106-1-p0">No doubt this par­ti­cu­lar mix of views will con­ti­nue to puz­zle some.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-106-2-p0">How can I be­lie­ve in re­gu­la­ti­on and yet be so skep­ti­cal about go­vern­ment?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-106-3-p0">But it doesn’t take much ima­gi­na­ti­on to un­der­stand how these ap­pa­r­ent­ly con­flic­ting views can go to­ge­ther.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-106-4-p0">I take it we all be­lie­ve in the po­ten­ti­al of me­di­ci­ne.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-106-5-p0">But ima­gi­ne your at­ti­tu­de if you were con­fron­ted with a “doc­tor” car­ry­ing a vial of lee­ches.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-106-6-p0">There’s much we could do in this con­text, or at least, that is my view.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-106-7-p0">But there’s a very good re­a­son not to want to do any­thing with this par­ti­cu­lar doc­tor.</span>
