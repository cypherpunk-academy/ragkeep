      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-4-1-p0">This is a trans­la­ti­on of an old book—in­de­ed, in In­ter­net time, it is a trans­la­ti­on of an an­ci­ent text.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-4-2-p0">The first edi­ti­on of this book was pu­blis­hed in 1999.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-4-3-p0">It was writ­ten in a very dif­fe­rent con­text, and, in many ways, it was writ­ten in op­po­si­ti­on to that con­text.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-4-4-p0">Ass I de­scri­be in the first chap­ter, the do­mi­nant idea among those who raved about cy­ber­space then was that cy­ber­space was bey­ond the reach of real-space re­gu­la­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-4-5-p0">Go­vern­ments couldn’t touch life on­line.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-4-6-p0">And hence, life on­line would be dif­fe­rent, and se­pa­ra­te, from the dy­na­mic of life off­line.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-4-7-p0"><em>Code v1</em> was an ar­gu­ment against that then com­mon view.</span>
        
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="book-paragraph" id="p-1-5">
      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-5-1-p0">In the years since, that com­mon view has faded.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-5-2-p0">The con­fi­dence of the In­ter­net ex­cep­tio­na­lists has waned.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-5-3-p0">The idea—and even the de­si­re—that the In­ter­net would re­main un­re­gu­la­ted is gone.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-5-4-p0">And thus, in ac­cep­t­ing the in­vi­ta­ti­on to up­date this book, I faced a dif­fi­cult choice: whe­ther to write a new book, or to up­date the old, to make it re­le­vant and re­a­da­ble in a ra­di­cal­ly dif­fe­rent time.</span>

      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-6-1-p0">I’ve done the lat­ter.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-6-2-p0">The basic struc­tu­re of the first edi­ti­on re­mains, and the ar­gu­ment ad­van­ced is the same.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-6-3-p0">But I’ve chan­ged the framing of par­ti­cu­lar ex­am­ples, and, I hope, the cla­ri­ty of the wri­ting.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-6-4-p0">I’ve also ex­ten­ded the ar­gu­ment in some parts, and added brief links to later work in order to bet­ter in­te­gra­te the ar­gu­ment of the ori­gi­nal book.</span>

      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-7-1-p0">One thing I have not done, howe­ver, is ex­tend the ar­gu­ment of this book in the pla­ces that others have worked.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-7-2-p0">Nor have I suc­cum­bed to the (in­sa­nely power­ful) temp­ta­ti­on to re­wri­te the book as a re­s­pon­se to cri­tics, both sym­pa­the­tic and not.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-7-3-p0">I have in­clu­ded di­rec­tion in the notes for those wan­ting to fol­low the ar­gu­ments others have made in re­s­pon­se.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-7-4-p0">But, even more than when it was first pu­blis­hed, this book is just a small part of a much big­ger de­ba­te.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-7-5-p0">Thus, you shouldn’t read this to the ex­clu­si­on of ex­tra­or­di­na­ry later work.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-7-6-p0">Two books in par­ti­cu­lar al­re­a­dy pu­blis­hed nice­ly com­ple­ment the ar­gu­ment made here—Golds­mith and Wu’s <em>Who Con­trols the Net?</em> (2006), and Benk­ler’s <em>The Wealth of Net­works</em> (2006)—and a third by Zit­train, ex­pec­ted in 2007, si­gni­fi­cant­ly ex­tends the same ar­gu­ment.</span>

    <section class="book-paragraph" id="p-1-8">
      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-8-1-p0">I have also not tried to en­u­me­ra­te the mis­ta­kes, real and al­le­ged, made in the first edi­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-8-2-p0">Some I’ve sim­ply cor­rec­ted, and some I’ve kept, be­cau­se, howe­ver mis­ta­ken others take them to be, I con­ti­nue to be­lie­ve that they are not mis­ta­kes.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-8-3-p0">The most im­portant of the se­cond type is my view that the in­fra­struc­tu­re of the Net will be­co­me in­cre­a­sin­gly con­trol­led and re­gulable through di­gi­tal iden­ti­ty tech­no­lo­gies.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-8-4-p0">Fri­ends have cal­led this “mis­ta­ke” a “whop­per.” It is not.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-8-5-p0">I’m not sure what time ho­ri­zon I had in mind in 1999, and I con­ce­de that some of the pre­dic­tions made there have not come to pass—yet.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-8-6-p0">But I am more con­fi­dent today than I was then, and thus I have cho­sen to stick with this “fun­da­men­tal mis­ta­ke.” Per­haps this is sim­ply to hedge my bets: If I’m right, then I have the re­ward of un­der­stan­ding.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-8-7-p0">If I’m wrong, then we’ll have an In­ter­net clo­ser to the va­lues of its ori­gi­nal de­sign.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-9-1-p0">The ge­ne­sis of the re­vi­si­ons found here was a wiki.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-9-2-p0">Basic Books al­lo­wed me to post the ori­gi­nal edi­ti­on of the book in a wiki hosted by Jots­pot, and a team of “chap­ter cap­ta­ins” hel­ped fa­ci­li­ta­te a con­ver­sa­ti­on about the text.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-9-3-p0">There were some edits to the text its­elf, and many more va­luable com­ments and cri­ti­cisms.^1 I then took that text as of the end of 2005 and added my own edits to pro­du­ce this book.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-9-4-p0">While I wouldn’t go as far as the mu­si­ci­an Jeff Tweedy (“Half of it’s you, half is me”), an im­portant part of this is not my work.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-9-5-p0">In re­co­gni­ti­on of that, I’ve com­mit­ted the royal­ties from this book to the non­pro­fit Crea­ti­ve Com­mons.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-11-2-p0">This work began with four—David Ryan Brum­berg, Jyh-An Lee, Bret Logue, and Adam Pugh—who spent a sum­mer collec­ting all the work that built upon or cri­ti­ci­zed <em>Code v1</em>. I re­li­ed upon that re­se­arch in part to de­ci­de how to mo­di­fy <em>Code v1</em>. Du­ring the fall se­mes­ter, 2005, a se­mi­nar of Stan­ford stu­dents added their own cri­ti­cal take, as well as clas­ses at Car­do­zo Law School.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-11-3-p0">And then du­ring the year, two other stu­dents, John Eden and Avi Lev Ro­bin­son-Mos­her, spent many hours hel­ping me com­ple­te the re­se­arch ne­cessa­ry to fi­nish a re­a­sonable draft of <em>Code v2</em>.</span>
