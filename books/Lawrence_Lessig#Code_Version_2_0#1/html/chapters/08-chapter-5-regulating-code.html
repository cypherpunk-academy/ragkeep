        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-1-p0">When I wrote the first ver­si­on of this book, I cer­tain­ly ex­pec­ted that the go­vern­ment would even­tual­ly take these steps.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-2-p0">Events since 1999—in­clu­ding the birth of Z-theo­ry de­scri­bed below—have only in­crea­sed my con­fi­dence.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-3-p0">In the United Sta­tes, the iden­ti­fi­ca­ti­on of “an enemy”—ter­ro­rism—has wea­k­e­ned the re­sol­ve to re­sist go­vern­ment ac­tion to make go­vern­ment more power­ful and re­gu­la­ti­on more ef­fec­tive.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-4-p0">There’s a limit, or at least I hope there is, but there is also no doubt that the line has been moved.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-5-p0">And in any case, there is not much more that the go­vern­ment would need to do in order to ra­di­cal­ly in­crea­se the re­gu­la­bi­li­ty of the net.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-6-p0">These steps would not them­sel­ves ex­ci­te any si­gni­fi­cant re­sis­tan­ce.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-5-1-p0">The trick is ob­vious once it is seen.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-5-2-p0">It may well be dif­fi­cult for the go­vern­ment to re­gu­la­te be­ha­vi­or di­rect­ly, given the ar­chi­tec­tu­re of the In­ter­net as it is.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-5-3-p0">But that doesn’t mean it is dif­fi­cult for the go­vern­ment to re­gu­la­te the ar­chi­tec­tu­re of the In­ter­net as it is.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-5-4-p0">The trick, then, is for the go­vern­ment to take steps that in­du­ce the de­ve­lop­ment of an ar­chi­tec­tu­re that makes be­ha­vi­or more re­gulable.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-6-2-p0">Ins­tead, I sim­ply mean re­gu­la­ti­on that chan­ges the ef­fec­tive cons­traints of the ar­chi­tec­tu­re of the In­ter­net, by al­te­ring the code at any layer wi­t­hin that space.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-6-3-p0">If tech­no­lo­gies of iden­ti­fi­ca­ti­on are lacking, then re­gu­la­ting the ar­chi­tec­tu­re in this sense means steps the go­vern­ment can take to in­du­ce the de­ploy­ment of tech­no­lo­gies of iden­ti­fi­ca­ti­on.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-7-2-p0">And de­pen­ding upon the sub­stan­ce of these steps taken, it could ren­der the In­ter­net the most per­fect­ly re­gulable space we’ve known.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-7-3-p0">Ass Mi­cha­el Geist de­scri­bes it, “go­vern­ments may have been wil­ling to step aside du­ring the com­mer­ci­al In­ter­net’s nas­cent years, but no lon­ger.”3</span>
