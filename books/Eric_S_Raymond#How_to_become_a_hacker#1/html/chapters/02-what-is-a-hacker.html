        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-1-2-p0">If you want to know how to be­co­me a ha­cker, though, only two are re­al­ly re­le­vant.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-2-1-p0">There is a com­mu­ni­ty, a sha­red cul­tu­re, of ex­pert pro­gramm­ers and net­wor­king wi­zards that tra­ces its his­to­ry back through de­ca­des to the first time-sharing mi­ni­com­pu­ters and the ear­liest AR­PA­net ex­pe­ri­ments.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-2-2-p0">The mem­bers of this cul­tu­re ori­gi­na­ted the term 'ha­cker'.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-2-3-p0">Ha­ckers built the In­ter­net.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-2-4-p0">Ha­ckers made the Unix ope­ra­ting sys­tem what it is today.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-2-5-p0">Ha­ckers make the World Wide Web work.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-2-6-p0">If you are part of this cul­tu­re, if you have cont­ri­bu­ted to it and other peop­le in it know who you are and call you a ha­cker, you're a ha­cker.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-3-1-p0">The ha­cker mind-set is not con­fi­ned to this soft­ware-ha­cker cul­tu­re.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-3-2-p0">There are peop­le who apply the ha­cker at­ti­tu­de to other things, like elec­tro­nics or music — ac­tual­ly, you can find it at the hig­hest le­vels of any sci­ence or art. Soft­ware ha­ckers re­co­gni­ze these kind­red spi­rits el­sew­he­re and may call them 'ha­ckers' too — and some claim that the ha­cker na­tu­re is re­al­ly in­de­pen­dent of the par­ti­cu­lar me­di­um the ha­cker works in.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-3-3-p0">But in the rest of this do­cu­ment we will focus on the skills and at­ti­tu­des of soft­ware ha­ckers, and the tra­di­ti­ons of the sha­red cul­tu­re that ori­gi­na­ted the term 'ha­cker'.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-4-1-p0">There is ano­ther group of peop­le who loud­ly call them­sel­ves ha­ckers, but aren't. These are peop­le (main­ly ado­lescent males) who get a kick out of brea­king into com­pu­ters and phrea­king the phone sys­tem.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-4-2-p0">Real ha­ckers call these peop­le 'cra­ckers' and want not­hing to do with them.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-4-3-p0">Real ha­ckers most­ly think cra­ckers are lazy, ir­re­s­pon­si­ble, and not very bright, and ob­ject that being able to break se­cu­ri­ty doesn't make you a ha­cker any more than being able to hot­wire cars makes you an au­to­mo­ti­ve en­gi­neer.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-4-4-p0">Un­for­t­u­n­a­te­ly, many jour­na­lists and wri­ters have been foo­led into using the word 'ha­cker' to de­scri­be cra­ckers; this ir­ri­ta­tes real ha­ckers no end.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-2-6-3-p0">And that's all I'm going to say about cra­ckers.</span>
