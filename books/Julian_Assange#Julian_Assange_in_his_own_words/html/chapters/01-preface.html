        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-1-p0">Frank Ni­chol­son, li­bra­ri­an of the Uni­ver­si­ty of Edin­burgh in 1917, re­cal­led his fri­endship with a young Bri­tish of­fi­cer that au­tumn: “He was one of those to whom the mi­se­ries of the world are mi­se­ry and will not let them rest, and he went back to spend his life doing what he could to pal­lia­te them.” The of­fi­cer was a twen­ty-four-year-old se­cond lieu­ten­ant un­der­go­ing tre­at­ment for shell shock at Crai­glock­hart War Hos­pi­tal.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-2-p0">He was also a poet.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-3-p0">His name was Wilf­red Owen.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-4-p0">Owen re­co­ve­r­ed and re­tur­ned to the war to pal­lia­te the mi­se­ry of the men under his com­mand.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-5-p0">His em­pa­thy for suf­fe­ring hu­ma­ni­ty ex­ten­ded to en­emies, who sha­red the same bru­tal ex­pe­ri­en­ces.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-6-p0">He stu­di­ed Ger­man under Ni­chol­son to build fri­endships after the war.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-7-p0">His death from Ger­man ma­chi­ne-gun fire four days be­fo­re the Great War ended on No­vem­ber 11, 1918, made that im­pos­si­ble.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-8-p0">Owen, whose great poems “Dulce et De­co­rum Est” and “An­them for Doo­med Youth” con­se­cra­te the sa­cri­fices of the First World War, re­sem­bles no one in our time as much as Ju­li­an Ass­an­ge.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-9-p0">i Like Owen, Ass­an­ge has taken the side of the vic­tims against the power­ful who con­spi­re against them in se­cret.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-10-p0">Like Owen, Ass­an­ge has paid a price in men­tal an­gu­ish.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-11-p0">He may also, like Owen, pay with his life if his per­se­cu­ti­on is pro­lon­ged.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-12-p0">Bri­tish Ma­gis­tra­te Va­nes­sa Ba­raitser’s de­ci­si­on of 4 Ja­nu­a­ry this year to deny the Ame­ri­can ap­p­li­ca­ti­on for Ass­an­ge’s ex­tra­di­ti­on to the United Sta­tes is, for the mo­ment, a stay of exe­cu­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-13-p0">The Bri­tish aut­ho­ri­ties, ra­ther than re­lease him, re­tur­ned him to his cell in in the no­to­rious Bel­mar­sh Ma­xi­mum Se­cu­ri­ty Pri­son to await the go­vern­ment’s ap­peal.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-14-p0">If a hig­her court re­ver­ses Ba­raitser’s ver­dict, Ass­an­ge will pro­ceed to the United Sta­tes for a trial on 18 cri­mi­nal char­ges, most under the dra­co­ni­an 1917 Es­pio­na­ge Act, and a ma­xi­mum sen­tence of 175 years.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-15-p0">If the court upholds her jud­ge­ment, Ass­an­ge may at last go free.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-16-p0">The pro­cess may last a year.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-17-p0">Me­anw­hi­le, he must en­du­re the same ter­ri­b­le con­di­ti­ons that have re­du­ced his health to the extent that Ma­gis­tra­te Ba­raitser did not be­lie­ve he would sur­vi­ve more pu­ni­ti­ve con­fi­ne­ment in the United Sta­tes.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-18-p0">Whi­che­ver way it goes, the mes­sa­ge is clear: do not mess with the na­tio­nal se­cu­ri­ty state.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-19-p0">Its reach is long, and its fist is hard.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-20-p0">It is safer for jour­na­lists to write about fa­shionable clo­thing, fast cars, gour­met food, and other com­mo­di­ties, in­clu­ding ce­le­bri­ties, that pro­vi­de an ad­ver­ti­sing-fri­end­ly en­vi­ron­ment.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-21-p0">Don’t pry.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-22-p0">Tell whist­leb­lo­wers to keep their do­cu­ments and con­ce­al cri­mi­na­li­ty.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-23-p0">Don’t bo­ther the pu­blic with un­plea­sant facts.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-24-p0">After all, “All’s best in this, the best of all pos­si­ble worlds.” Those who don’t ac­cept that can swal­low Pur­due Phar­ma’s Oxy­Con­tin until they do.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-25-p0">That’s what it’s for.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-26-p0">In these pages, you will read Ju­li­an Ass­an­ge’s words as he wrote or spoke them.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-27-p0">They carry the aut­ho­ri­ty of the vic­tim’s ad­vo­ca­te who ris­ked his free­dom for them and for­fei­ted his li­ber­ty and his health.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-28-p0">“We do not have na­tio­nal se­cu­ri­ty con­cerns,” he says.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-29-p0">“We have con­cerns about human beings.” So did Owen, who wrote in the pre­face to a book of poems he did not live to see pu­blis­hed, “My sub­ject is War and the pity of War.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-30-p0">The poe­try is in the pity.” Ass­an­ge’s sub­ject too is war, what the Ame­ri­can-Is­rae­li wri­ter and dis­si­dent Jeff Hal­per cal­led “the war against the peop­le” in his book of that name.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-31-p0">No one rea­ding the mi­li­ta­ry ca­bles made pu­blic by Wi­ki­Leaks, with their ca­su­al dis­mis­sal of ci­vi­li­an de­aths and tor­tu­re, can avoid pity for war’s vic­tims.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-32-p0">Ass­an­ge, like Hal­per, has pro­vi­ded do­cu­men­ta­ry evi­dence of the ex­pan­si­on of sur­veil­lan­ce and con­trol of or­di­na­ry ci­ti­zens’ lives mir­ro­ring the Is­rae­li se­cu­ri­ty es­ta­blish­ment’s do­mi­na­ti­on of Pa­lesti­ni­ans under mi­li­ta­ry oc­cupa­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-33-p0">Not only Pa­lesti­ne, but much of the world, is a gi­gan­tic la­bo­ra­to­ry to test equip­ment, tech­ni­ques, psy­cho­lo­gi­cal ma­ni­pu­la­ti­on, and vio­lence to prevent peop­le from pro­tes­ting their power­less­ness and im­po­ve­rish­ment.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-34-p0">How else could hu­ma­ni­ty ac­cept that 1 per­cent of the po­pu­la­ti­on ho­ards 88 per­cent of the wealth while the poo­rest half makes do with 1 per­cent?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-35-p0">This book ser­ves as a cor­rec­tive to the dis­in­for­ma­ti­on sur­roun­ding Ju­li­an Ass­an­ge and Wi­ki­Leaks.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-36-p0">When the U.S. Army Coun­ter­in­tel­li­gence Cen­ter in­itia­ted what it cal­led a pro­gram to “da­ma­ge or de­s­troy this cen­ter of gra­vi­ty” cal­led Wi­ki­Leaks in 2008, the psy­cho­lo­gi­cal war­fa­re against Ass­an­ge began.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-37-p0">Other U.S. agen­cies—the Pen­ta­gon, the Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agen­cy, the Na­tio­nal Se­cu­ri­ty Agen­cy, and the State De­part­ment— fol­lo­wed the Army’s lead in in­ves­ti­ga­ting, sur­veil­ling, and de­fa­ming Ass­an­ge.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-38-p0">The re­sour­ces mo­bi­li­zed against a lone pu­blis­her and Jour­na­lists were un­pre­ce­den­ted, a tri­bu­te to Ass­an­ge’s im­pact.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-39-p0">So many lies have cir­cu­la­ted that the pu­blic has not had the chan­ce to know what Ass­an­ge has ac­tual­ly done and said.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-40-p0">Now, it does.</span>
