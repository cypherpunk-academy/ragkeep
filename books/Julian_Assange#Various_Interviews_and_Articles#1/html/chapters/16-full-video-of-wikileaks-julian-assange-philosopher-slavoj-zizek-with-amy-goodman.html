        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-3-p0">We all know that it’s cru­ci­al even eco­no­mi­cal­ly.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-4-p0">I claim that one of maybe the main re­a­sons ca­pi­ta­lism will get into cri­sis is in­tel­lec­tu­al pro­per­ty.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-5-p0">In the long term, it sim­ply can­not deal with it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-6-p0">But what I’m say­ing is just take the pheno­me­non that media are try­ing to get us en­thu­si­as­tic for clouds.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-7-p0">Like, you know, com­pu­ters get­ting smal­ler and smal­ler, and all is done for you up there in a cloud.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-8-p0">OK, but the pro­blem is that clouds are not up there in clouds.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-9-p0">They are con­trol­led and so on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-10-p0">For ex­amp­le, you rely on—maybe you have an iPho­ne.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-11-p0">But you men­tio­ned Mur­doch, name was men­tio­ned here.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-12-p0">Do you know—it’s good to know—if you rely on your news through iPho­ne or wha­te­ver, that Apple si­gned an ex­clu­si­ve agree­ment with Mur­doch?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-13-p0">Mur­doch’s cor­po­ra­ti­on is again the ex­clu­si­ve pro­vi­der of ent­i­re news, and so on and so on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-14-p0">This is the dan­ger today.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-15-p0">It’s no lon­ger this clear dis­tinc­tion: pri­va­te space/pu­blic space.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-35-16-p0">The pu­blic space its­elf gets, as it were, pri­va­ti­zed in a whole se­ries of in­vi­si­ble ways, like the model of it being clouds, which is why—and again, this in­vol­ves new modes of cen­sor­ship.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-1-p0">I re­peat this.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-2-p0">That’s why you shouldn’t be tri­cked when you say, “But what re­al­ly did we learn new?” Maybe we lear­ned not­hing new, but, you know, it’s the same as in that be­au­ti­ful old un­der­sen­se fai­ry­ta­le, “The Em­peror is Naked.” The em­peror is naked.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-3-p0">We may all know that the em­peror is naked, but the mo­ment some­bo­dy pu­bli­cly says, “The em­peror is naked,” ever­y­thing chan­ges.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-4-p0">This is why, even if we lear­ned not­hing new—but we did learn many new things—but even if not­hing lear­ned, the forum mat­ters.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-5-p0">So, don’t con­fu­se Ju­li­an and his gang—in a good sense, not the way they ac­cu­se you—don’t con­fu­se them with this usual bour­geois he­ro­ism, fight for in­ves­ti­ga­ti­ve jour­na­lism, free flow and so on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-6-p0">You are doing so­me­thing much more ra­di­cal.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-7-p0">You are—that’s why it arou­sed such an ex­plo­si­on of re­sent­ment.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-8-p0">You are not only vio­la­ting the rules, dis­clo­sing se­crets and so on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-9-p0">Let me call it in the old Mar­xist way the bour­geois press today has its own way to be trans­gres­si­ve.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-10-p0">Its ideo­lo­gy not only con­trols what you say, but even how you can vio­la­te what you are al­lo­wed to say.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-11-p0">You are not just vio­la­ting the rules.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-12-p0">You are chan­ging the very rules how we were al­lo­wed to vio­la­te the rules.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-36-13-p0">This is maybe the most im­portant thing you can do.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-42-1-p0">So, if you want to have an im­pact, and you pro­mi­se an im­pact, and you’re an or­ga­niza­t­i­on which is very small, well, ac­tual­ly, you have to co-opt or le­ver­age the rest of the main­stream press.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-42-2-p0">So, under our model of how you make an im­pact and how you get peop­le to do things that you wouldn’t have been other­wi­se able to do, un­less you have an army that can phy­si­cal­ly go some­place and pan­zer di­vi­si­ons that can roll over, the only way that you can ea­si­ly make an im­pact is push in­for­ma­ti­on about the world to many, many peop­le across the world.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-42-3-p0">And so, the main­stream press has de­ve­l­o­ped ex­per­ti­se on how to do that.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-42-4-p0">And it is com­pe­ti­ti­on also for peop­le’s at­ten­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-42-5-p0">So, if we had had se­veral bil­li­on dol­lars to spend on ad­ver­ti­sing across the world, even if we can get our ads pla­ced, we wouldn’t ea­si­ly be able to have made the same im­pact that we did.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-42-6-p0">And we don’t have that kind of money.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-44-2-p0">It can­not do any­thing else wi­thout view­ers.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-44-3-p0">So, it will try and push news con­tent.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-44-4-p0">So, for ex­amp­le, with Col­la­te­ral Mur­der, CNN show­ed only the first few se­conds, and they blan­ked out all the bul­lets going to the street, com­ple­te­ly blan­ked it out, and said that they did so out of re­spect for the fa­mi­lies of the peop­le who were kil­led.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-44-5-p0">Well, there was no blood, there was no gore.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-44-6-p0">And then they cut out all the most po­li­ti­cal­ly sa­li­ent points.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-44-7-p0">And the fa­mi­lies had come for­ward and said it was very im­portant for us to know that they had al­re­a­dy seen it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-44-8-p0">But Fox ac­tual­ly dis­play­ed the first kil­ling scene in full.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-44-9-p0">It’s quite in­te­res­ting.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-44-10-p0">So, Fox, not per­cei­ving its­elf to be amenable to the thre­at of it not ac­ting in a moral way, ac­tual­ly gave peop­le more of the truth than CNN did.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-44-11-p0">And so, Fox, also mo­ti­va­ted to grab in a hungry way as great an au­di­ence share as pos­si­ble, took this con­tent and gave it to more peop­le.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-44-12-p0">Now, af­ter­wards, of cour­se, they put in their com­men­ta­tors to talk against it, but I think the truth that we got out of Fox was often stron­ger than the truth that we got out of CNN, and si­mi­lar­ly for many in­sti­tu­ti­ons in the media that we think of as li­be­ral.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-78-3-p0">He said, “Whoever in our go­vern­ment lea­k­ed that in­for­ma­ti­on is guil­ty of tre­a­son, and I think any­thing less than exe­cu­ti­on is too kind a pe­nal­ty.” Brad­ley Man­ning is a young U.S. sol­dier who was in Iraq, has been held for more than a year, much of that time in so­li­ta­ry con­fi­ne­ment in Quan­ti­co in Vir­gi­nia.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-78-4-p0">It was ex­po­sed that his tre­at­ment was tanta­mount to tor­tu­re.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-79-1-p0">First of all, Amy, thanks for as­king this ques­ti­on, but it is dif­fi­cult for me to speak in de­tail about that case, and—but I can speak about why it is dif­fi­cult for me to speak about it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-79-2-p0">So, Brad­ley Man­ning is an al­le­ged sour­ce of Wi­ki­Leaks who was de­tai­ned in Bagh­dad, and then, alt­hough there was very litt­le—no main­stream press pu­bli­ci­ty at the time, ship­ped off to Ku­wait, where he was, if you like, held in an ex­tra­ju­di­ci­al cir­cum­stan­ce in Ku­wait, in a si­mi­lar man­ner to which de­tainees are held in Guantánamo Bay.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-79-3-p0">Even­tual­ly, through some crea­ti­ve legal me­thods, he was brought back to the United Sta­tes, and he’s been in pri­son now for over a year.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-79-4-p0">He was being kept in Quan­ti­co for eight months under ex­tre­me­ly ad­ver­se con­di­ti­ons.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-79-5-p0">Quan­ti­co is not meant for long-term pri­so­ners.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-79-6-p0">Other pri­so­ners, the ma­xi­mum du­ra­ti­on over the past year has been three months.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-79-7-p0">And peop­le that have been vi­sit­ing Brad­ley Man­ning say—and we have other sour­ces who say—that they were ap­p­ly­ing those con­di­ti­ons to him be­cau­se they wan­ted him to con­fess that he was in­vol­ved in a con­spi­ra­cy to com­mit es­pio­na­ge against the United Sta­tes with me.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-79-8-p0">That pres­su­re on Man­ning ap­pears to have back­fi­red.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-79-9-p0">So, by all re­ports, this is a young man of high moral cha­rac­ter.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-79-10-p0">And when peop­le of high moral cha­rac­ter are pres­su­red in a way that is il­le­gi­ti­ma­te, they be­co­me stron­ger and not wea­ker.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-79-11-p0">And that seems to have been the case with Brad­ley Man­ning, and he has told U.S. aut­ho­ri­ties, as far as we know, not­hing about his in­vol­ve­ment.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-113-8-p0">So they ad­mit­ted that the big—you re­mem­ber three years ago when the big Si­chuan, or where—ear­t­h­qua­ke was, if not trig­ge­red, de­fi­ni­te­ly ren­de­red much stron­ger be­cau­se of this.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-129-2-p0">But ac­tual­ly, the real si­tua­ti­on is much more rich and in­te­res­ting than that.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-129-3-p0">Ra­ther, yes, the demos knows, the po­pu­la­ti­on starts to know, and they start to know in a way that’s un­de­nia­ble, and they also start to know that the United Sta­tes knows, and the United Sta­tes can’t deny what was going on in­si­de Tu­ni­sia.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-129-4-p0">And then the eli­tes wi­t­hin the coun­try and wi­thout the coun­try also know what is going on and know they can’t deny it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-129-5-p0">So, a si­tua­ti­on de­ve­l­o­ped where it was not pos­si­ble for the United Sta­tes to sup­port the Ben Ali re­gime and in­ter­vene in a re­vo­lu­ti­on in Tu­ni­sia in the way that it might have.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-129-6-p0">Si­mi­lar­ly, it was not pos­si­ble for Francé to sup­port Ben Ali or other part­ners in the same way that they might have been able to.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-130-2-p0">That is, we have Saudi Ara­bia, for ex­amp­le, prop­ping up a num­ber of sta­tes in the Midd­le East, and in fact in­va­ding Bah­rain even to do this.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-130-3-p0">But when these sta­tes have pro­blems of their own to deal with and po­li­ti­cal cri­ses of their own to deal with, they turn in­wards, and they can’t be in­vol­ved in this prop-up.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-130-4-p0">So, Cab­le­ga­te, as a whole, cau­sed these eli­tes that prop each other up in the re­gi­on, wi­t­hin the Arab-spea­king coun­tries, and wi­t­hin—bet­ween Eu­ro­pe and these coun­tries and bet­ween the United Sta­tes and these coun­tries, to have to deal with their own po­li­ti­cal cri­ses and not spend time gi­ving in­tel­li­gence brie­fings on ac­tivists or sen­ding in the SAS or other sup­port.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-130-5-p0">And ac­tivists wi­t­hin Tu­ni­sia saw this.</span>

But ac­tual­ly, what it seems to be tal­king about, if you think about it, given the rea­li­ty that three peop­le a day are ex­tra­di­ted from this coun­try to the rest of Eu­ro­pe, is a mu­tu­al re­co­gni­ti­on of the elite in each coun­try in the E.U.

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-160-3-p0">But this is cy­ni­cism at its pu­rist.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-160-4-p0">You re­mem­ber this out­cry in Zio­nist cir­cles where Obama made the sim­ple point that—not even exact fron­tiers—that the basis of peace should be the bor­ders, the ’67 bor­ders.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-160-5-p0">My god, the cri­ti­cal re­ac­tion was as if Obama said so­me­thing—I don’t know—fol­lo­wing or­ders from al-Qaeda or what.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-160-6-p0">But this was the of­fi­ci­al U.S. po­li­cy ac­cep­ted.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-160-7-p0">Only the ob­s­ce­ni­ty of the si­tua­ti­on was that, alt­hough this was of­fi­ci­al­ly the U.S. po­li­cy, it was part of the un­writ­ten deal not to talk about it, to igno­re it.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-161-2-p0">I know—you know what’s for me—and you had here a lot—the truth about Egypt.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-161-3-p0">We, wes­tern Eu­ro­peans, had this nor­mal spon­ta­neous ra­cist at­ti­tu­de: no, we would love to see a se­cu­lar de­mo­cra­tic mo­ve­ment in Arab coun­tries; un­for­t­u­n­a­te­ly, all they can do is some stu­pid anti-Se­mi­tic, fun­da­men­ta­list, na­tio­na­list, wha­te­ver, out­burst.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-161-4-p0">Now, of­fi­ci­al­ly, we got ex­act­ly what we wan­ted, a pu­re­ly se­cu­lar upri­sing and so on, and you know how we be­ha­ved?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-161-5-p0">My last lo­ving, ob­s­ce­ne ex­amp­le.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-161-6-p0">Did you see François Truf­faut, Day and Night?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-161-7-p0">Where a guy wants to sleep with a girl, tries to con­vin­ce her for a long time, then fi­nal­ly they are alone be­cau­se of an ac­ci­dent by a lake, and again he starts, “Plea­se, let’s do it quick­ly.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-161-8-p0">We are alone here,” and the girl says, “OK, let’s do it,” and starts to un­but­ton her trou­sers.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-161-9-p0">And the guy says, “OK, but how do you mean?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-161-10-p0">My god, just like that?” or wha­te­ver, like he is sho­cked.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-161-11-p0">We were a litt­le bit like that.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-161-12-p0">Of­fi­ci­al­ly, we wan­ted se­cu­lar de­mo­cra­cy.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-162-1-p0">Now, re­al­ly to fi­nish, maybe the most im­portant thing, what you al­re­a­dy said, I think, Amy.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-162-2-p0">I think maybe this is one of the ways, if we are ap­proa­ching the end, to con­clu­de it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-162-3-p0">Even if you igno­re Wi­ki­Leaks, it’s chan­ged the ent­i­re field.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-162-4-p0">It’s, again, even at the level of pu­blis­hing, sprea­ding in­for­ma­ti­on, you pus­hed things in a very for­mal way, to a point of un­de­nia­bi­li­ty.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-162-5-p0">No­bo­dy can pre­tend that Wi­ki­Leaks didn’t hap­pen.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-162-6-p0">And it would be very in­te­res­ting to clas­si­fy all re­ac­tions to Wi­ki­Leaks.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-162-7-p0">You know, as dif­fe­rent forms of, in psy­cho­ana­ly­tic terms, re­pres­si­on, de­ni­al, wha­te­ver, some peop­le say for­mal­ly, “Yeah, yeah,” but try to neu­tra­li­ze it, like, “Ooh, ano­ther chap­ter in free­dom of the press, in­ves­ti­ga­ti­ve jour­na­lism.” Others say di­rect­ly ter­ro­rism.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-162-8-p0">I won­der the ap­proach I would have fol­lo­wed if I were to be on the other side, would have been so­me­thing like, “It’s ba­si­cal­ly a good thing.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-162-9-p0">It’s just mi­sus­ed by some ex­tre­mists, you know.” And then you kind of say, pre­cise­ly to save the safe core of—good core of Wi­ki­Leaks.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-162-10-p0">So, what I am say­ing is that, again, to con­clu­de—don’t worry—this is the mo­ment of truth.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-162-11-p0">Wi­ki­Leaks is an event, not only be­cau­se of what exists as in its­elf, but be­cau­se no­bo­dy can igno­re it, it chan­ged the ent­i­re field.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-162-12-p0">The point is not to allow to be re­nor­ma­li­zed, to re­main faith­ful to it.</span>
