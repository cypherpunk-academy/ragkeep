        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-2-1-p0">We cut you off ear­lier when you were tal­king about what you felt were the most si­gni­fi­cant emails that you have re­leased.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-2-2-p0">Is there any last one that you'd like to men­ti­on?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-2-3-p0">And also, do you have any thoughts on Do­nald Trump?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-2-4-p0">I mean, just be­fo­re we went to air, a CNN poll came out that says Do­nald Trump is ahead by five per­cen­ta­ge points of Hil­la­ry Clin­ton.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-2-5-p0">Now, he did just come off of the Re­pu­bli­can con­ven­ti­on, but many cal­led it the worst con­ven­ti­on in his­to­ry.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-2-6-p0">So it's not au­to­ma­tic that he should have had this per­cen­ta­ge lead.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-2-7-p0">Of cour­se, though, you have the cri­sis, the dis­ar­ray the De­mo­cra­tic Party is in be­cau­se of these emails that you've re­leased.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-3-1-p0">Well, you're as­king me, do I pre­fer cho­le­ra or go­nor­rhea.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-3-2-p0">Per­so­nal­ly, I would pre­fer neit­her.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-3-3-p0">Look, I think, you know, we know how po­li­tics works in the United Sta­tes.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-3-4-p0">Whoever, wha­te­ver po­li­ti­cal party gets into go­vern­ment is going to merge with the bu­reau­cra­cy pret­ty damn fast.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-3-5-p0">It'll be in a po­si­ti­on where it has some le­vers in its hand.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-3-6-p0">And so, as a re­sult, the cor­po­ra­te lob­by­ists will move in to help to con­trol those le­vers.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-3-7-p0">So it doesn't make much dif­fe­rence in the end.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-3-8-p0">What does make a dif­fe­rence is po­li­ti­cal ac­coun­ta­bi­li­ty, a ge­ne­ral de­ter­rence set to stop po­li­ti­cal or­ga­niza­t­i­ons be­ha­ving in a cor­rupt man­ner.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-3-9-p0">That can make a dif­fe­rence, be­cau­se that chan­ges the per­cep­ti­on of what you can do or not do.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-3-10-p0">And so, al­ways—well, al­most al­ways, you should choo­se the prin­ci­pled po­si­ti­on, which is to set a di­sci­pli­na­ry si­gnal about ac­ting in a cor­rupt way and take a phi­lo­so­phi­cal po­si­ti­on, which is our in­sti­tu­ti­ons can only be as good as our un­der­stan­ding of our in­sti­tu­ti­ons.</span>

      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-5-1-p0">The other top emails—well, as I said, I think this in­struc­tion by Lewis Mi­ran­da, the head of com­mu­ni­ca­ti­ons, to go out and co­vert­ly spre­ad anti-Ber­nie San­ders pro­pa­gan­da is a clear in­struc­tion com­bi­ned with a chain of com­mand.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-5-2-p0">It's not sim­ply ex­pres­sing a sen­ti­ment.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-5-3-p0">It is ex­pres­sing in­struc­tion wi­t­hin the DNC to sub­vert the Ber­nie San­ders cam­pai­gn.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-5-4-p0">Then there's a lot of emails about the close re­la­ti­ons­hip bet­ween the DNC and the media.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-5-5-p0">The Wa­shing­ton Post in­vol­ved in a co-fund­rai­sing party, an off-list co-fund­rai­sing party for the DNC, cal­ling up MSNBC du­ring the midd­le of a pro­gram and say­ing, pull that seg­ment now.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-5-6-p0">Debbie Was­ser­man Schultz cal­ling up the pre­si­dent of MSNBC in order to di­sci­pli­ne Morning Joe, etc.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-5-7-p0">That's, you know, of cour­se, so­me­thing that we've all sus­pec­ted hap­pens, that this is con­cre­te proof.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-5-8-p0">But, you know, I re­al­ly en­cou­ra­ge peop­le to re­se­arch the more than 8,000 at­tach­ments that we put out, se­pa­ra­te files, in­clu­ding more than 175 spreads­heets.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-5-9-p0">That has the real core, the fi­nan­ci­al core of the power struc­tu­re and the ex­er­cise of mo­ne­ta­ry in­flu­ence over the DNC.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-27-5-10-p0">And that's so­me­thing that's going to seed jour­na­lis­tic in­ves­ti­ga­ti­ons for years.</span>
