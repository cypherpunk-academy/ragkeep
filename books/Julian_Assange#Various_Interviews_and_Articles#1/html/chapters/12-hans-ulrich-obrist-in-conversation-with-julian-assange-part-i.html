        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-2-1-p0">When I first met Ju­li­an Ass­an­ge—thanks to la­wy­er and Chair of the Con­tem­pora­ry Art So­cie­ty Mark Ste­phens and cu­ra­tor/la­wy­er Da­ni­el Mc­Cle­an, both of the law firm Fi­ners Ste­phens In­no­cent—we dis­cus­sed ideas for va­rious in­ter­view for­mats.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-2-2-p0">Anton Vi­dok­le and I had dis­cus­sed the idea to con­duct an in­ter­view with Ass­an­ge in which ques­ti­ons would be posed not only by me, but also by a num­ber of ar­tists.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-2-3-p0">This see­med only na­tu­ral con­side­ring the extent to which so many ar­tists have been in­te­rested in Wi­ki­Leaks, and we then in­vi­ted seven ar­tists and collec­tives to ask ques­ti­ons over video for the se­cond part of the in­ter­view.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-3-1-p0">My ar­chi­ve now con­ta­ins over 2000 hours of in­ter­views re­cor­ded in many dif­fe­rent pla­ces, and I am con­stant­ly at­temp­t­ing to dis­co­ver new rules of the game, new ap­proa­ches to how an in­ter­view can work.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-3-2-p0">For an in­ter­view with Hans-Peter Feld­mann pu­blis­hed in­iti­al­ly in AnO­ther Ma­ga­zi­ne and then in book form, I emai­led him one ques­ti­on per day, and each of Feld­mann’s re­s­pon­ses would take the form of an image.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-3-3-p0">For my in­ter­view with Loui­se Bour­geois, I would send a ques­ti­on and she would email back a drawing.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-3-4-p0">When Ju­li­an came to my of­fice with Mark and Da­ni­el for our first mee­ting, we dis­cus­sed the idea of a dif­fe­rent for­mat with ques­ti­ons from ar­tists, and Ju­li­an liked this a lot, sug­gesting that the ar­tists send the ques­ti­ons as short vi­de­os so that he could see them.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-3-5-p0">We set the in­ter­view for two weeks later at 10 or 11 p.m., as we dis­co­ve­r­ed that we both work late at night.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-3-6-p0">Tra­ve­ling more than three hours from Lon­don on Sun­day, Fe­bru­ary 27, I ar­ri­ved at El­ling­ham Hall, the Geor­gi­an man­si­on near the Eas­tern coast of Eng­land that Vaug­han Smith of­fe­red Ju­li­an to use as his ad­dress for bail du­ring his UK ex­tra­di­ti­on hea­rings.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-3-7-p0">In the li­ving room of the pic­tures­que home he de­scri­bed to me as a “gol­den cage” we drank many cups of cof­fee and spoke until 3 a.m. about his life, his no­ma­dism, his early be­gin­nings and the in­ven­ti­on of Wi­ki­Leaks, his time in Egypt, Kenya, Ice­land, and other pla­ces, his sci­en­ti­fic back­ground, and the theo­re­ti­cal un­der­pin­nings of Wi­ki­Leaks.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-4-2-p0">I was not in­te­rested in his court case or pri­va­te life, but in his pu­blic work as the voice of Wi­ki­Leaks, and the ex­pe­ri­en­ces and phi­lo­so­phi­cal back­ground that in­forms such a mo­nu­men­tal­ly po­le­mi­cal pro­ject.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-4-3-p0">In the se­cond part, which will be pu­blis­hed in the fol­lo­wing issue of e-flux jour­nal, Ass­an­ge re­sponds to ques­ti­ons posed to him by ar­tists Gol­din+Sen­ne­by, Paul Chan, Me­ta­ha­ven (Da­ni­el van der Vel­den and Vinca Kruk), Mar­tha Ros­ler, Luis Cam­nit­zer, Su­per­flex, Phil­ip­pe Par­reno, and Ai Wei­wei.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-8-1-p0">I grew up in Aus­tra­lia in the 1970s. My par­ents were in the thea­t­re, so I lived ever­yw­he­re—in over fifty dif­fe­rent towns, at­ten­ding thir­ty-seven dif­fe­rent schools.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-8-2-p0">Many of these towns were in rural en­vi­ron­ments, so I lived like Tom Sa­wy­er—ri­ding hor­ses, ex­plo­ring caves, fis­hing, di­ving, and ri­ding my motor­cy­cle.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-8-3-p0">I lived a clas­si­cal boyhood in this re­gard.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-8-4-p0">But there were other events, such as in Ade­lai­de, where my mo­ther was in­vol­ved in hel­ping to smugg­le in­for­ma­ti­on out of Ma­ra­lin­ga, the Bri­tish ato­mic bomb test site in the out­back.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-8-5-p0">She and I and a cou­rier were de­tai­ned one night by the Aus­tra­li­an Fe­deral Po­li­ce, who told her that it could be said that she was an unfit mo­ther to be ke­eping such com­pa­ny at 2:00 a.m., and that she had bet­ter stay out of po­li­tics if she didn’t want to hear such things.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-9-1-p0">I was very cu­rious as a child, al­ways as­king why, and al­ways wan­ting to over­co­me bar­ri­ers to kno­wing, which meant that by the time I was around fif­teen I was brea­king en­cryp­ti­on sys­tems that were used to stop peop­le sharing soft­ware, and then, later on, brea­king sys­tems that were used to hide in­for­ma­ti­on in go­vern­ment com­pu­ters.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-9-2-p0">Aus­tra­lia was a very pro­vin­ci­al place be­fo­re the in­ter­net, and it was a great de­light to be able to get out, in­tel­lec­tual­ly, into the wider world, to tun­nel through it and un­der­stand it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-9-3-p0">For so­meo­ne who was young and re­la­tive­ly re­mo­ved from the rest of the world, to be able to enter the depths of the Pen­ta­gon’s Eighth Com­mand at the age of seven­teen was a li­be­ra­ting ex­pe­ri­ence.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-9-4-p0">But our group, which cen­te­red on the un­der­ground ma­ga­zi­ne I foun­ded, was rai­ded by the Fe­deral Po­li­ce.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-9-5-p0">It was a big ope­ra­ti­on.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-11-2-p0">This led me to using cryp­to­gra­phy to pro­tect human rights, in novel ways, and even­tual­ly as a re­sult of what I was doing in ma­the­ma­tics and in phy­sics and po­li­ti­cal ac­tivism, things see­med to come to­ge­ther and show that there was a limit to what I was doing—and what the rest of the world was doing.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-11-3-p0">There was not en­ough in­for­ma­ti­on avail­able in our com­mon in­tel­lec­tu­al re­cord to ex­plain how the world re­al­ly works.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-11-4-p0">These were more the fee­lings and pro­cess, but they sug­gested a big­ger ques­ti­on, with a stron­ger phi­lo­so­phi­cal an­s­wer for ex­plai­ning what is mis­sing.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-11-5-p0">We are mis­sing one of the pil­lars of his­to­ry.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-11-6-p0">There are three types of his­to­ry.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-11-7-p0">Type one is know­ledge.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-11-8-p0">Its crea­ti­on is sub­si­di­zed, and its main­ten­an­ce is sub­si­di­zed by an in­dus­try or lobby: things like how to build a pump that pumps water, how to crea­te steel and build other forms of al­loys, how to cook, how to re­mo­ve poi­sons from food, etc.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-11-9-p0">But be­cau­se this know­ledge is part of ever­y­day in­dus­tri­al pro­ces­ses, there is an eco­no­my that keeps such in­for­ma­ti­on around and makes use of it.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-5-p0">There’s a uni­ver­se of in­for­ma­ti­on, and we can ima­gi­ne a sort of Pla­to­nic ideal in which we have an in­fi­ni­te ho­ri­zon of in­for­ma­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-6-p0">It’s si­mi­lar to the con­cept of the Tower of Babel.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-7-p0">Ima­gi­ne a field be­fo­re us com­po­sed of all the in­for­ma­ti­on that exists in the world—in­si­de go­vern­ment com­pu­ters, peop­le’s let­ters, things that have al­re­a­dy been pu­blis­hed, the stream of in­for­ma­ti­on co­m­ing out of te­le­vi­si­ons, this total know­ledge of all the world, both ac­ces­si­ble and in­ac­ces­si­ble to the pu­blic.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-8-p0">We can as a thought ex­pe­ri­ment ob­ser­ve this field and ask: If we want to use in­for­ma­ti­on to pro­du­ce ac­tions that af­fect the world to make it more just, which in­for­ma­ti­on will do that?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-9-p0">So what we ask for is a way to color the field of in­for­ma­ti­on be­fo­re us, to take a yel­low high­ligh­ter and mark the in­te­res­ting bits—all the in­for­ma­ti­on that is most li­kely to have that ef­fect on the world, which leads it toward the state we de­si­re.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-10-p0">But what is the si­gnal that per­mits us to do that?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-11-p0">What can we re­co­gni­ze when we look at the world from a dis­tan­ce?</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-14-p0">And what it’s glo­wing with is the amount of work that’s being put into sup­pres­sing it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-15-p0">So, when so­meo­ne wants to take in­for­ma­ti­on and li­te­r­al­ly stick it in a vault and sur­round it with guards, I say that they are doing eco­no­mic work to sup­press in­for­ma­ti­on from the world.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-16-p0">And why is so much eco­no­mic work being done to sup­press that in­for­ma­ti­on?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-17-p0">Pro­bab­ly—not de­fi­ni­te­ly, but pro­bab­ly—be­cau­se the or­ga­niza­t­i­on pre­dicts that it’s going to re­du­ce the power of the in­sti­tu­ti­on that con­ta­ins it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-18-p0">It’s going to pro­du­ce a chan­ge in the world, and the or­ga­niza­t­i­on doesn’t like that vi­si­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-19-p0">The­re­fo­re, the con­tai­ning in­sti­tu­ti­on en­ga­ges in con­stant eco­no­mic work to prevent that chan­ge.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-20-p0">So, if you se­arch for that si­gnal of sup­pres­si­on, then you can find all this in­for­ma­ti­on that you should mark as in­for­ma­ti­on that should be re­leased.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-40-21-p0">So, it was an epi­pha­ny to see the si­gnal of cen­sor­ship to al­ways be an op­por­tu­ni­ty, to see that when or­ga­niza­t­i­ons or go­vern­ments of va­rious kinds at­tempt to con­tain know­ledge and sup­press it, they are gi­ving you the most im­portant in­for­ma­ti­on you need to know: that there is so­me­thing worth loo­king at to see if it should be ex­po­sed and that cen­sor­ship ex­pres­ses weak­ness, not strength.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-56-2-p0">Some parts of that may be true, though two weeks later there was also a man who set him­s­elf on fire, the 26-year-old com­pu­ter tech­ni­ci­an, re­por­ted­ly be­cau­se of a dis­pu­te over a li­cen­se in the mar­ket.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-56-4-p0">But my sus­pi­ci­on is that one of the real dif­fe­ren­ces in the ca­bles about Tu­ni­sia came in sho­w­ing that the United Sta­tes, if push came to shove, would sup­port the army over Ben Ali.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-56-5-p0">That was a si­gnal, not just to the army, but to the other ac­tors in­si­de Tu­ni­sia, as well as to the sur­roun­ding sta­tes who might have been con­side­ring in­ter­ve­ning with their in­tel­li­gence ser­vices or mi­li­ta­ry on be­half of Ben Ali.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-56-7-p0">And it is clear that Tu­ni­sia, as an ex­amp­le, then set off all the pro­tests in the rest of the Midd­le East.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-56-8-p0">So when we saw what was hap­pe­ning in Tu­ni­sia, we knew that Egypt was on the bor­der­li­ne, and we saw these in­iti­al pro­tests in Egypt as a re­sult of Tu­ni­sia.</span>

      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-1-p0">We re­al­ly tried very hard to get out lots and lots of ca­bles, hund­reds of ca­bles, to show the abu­ses of Mu­ba­rak and so on, to give the pro­tes­tors some ad­di­tio­nal fuel, but also to re­mo­ve Wes­tern sup­port for Mu­ba­rak.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-2-p0">Now we also have Libya bor­de­ring Egypt.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-3-p0">Working with the Te­le­graph in the UK, we pus­hed out 480 ca­bles about Libya, re­vea­ling many abu­ses, but also in­tel­li­gence about how the Li­by­an re­gime ope­ra­ted—we re­mo­ved some of that Wes­tern sup­port for the Li­by­an re­gime, and per­haps some of the sup­port from the neigh­bo­ring coun­tries.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-4-p0">The ap­proach we took, and con­ti­nue to take, with the de­mons­tra­ti­ons in the Midd­le East, has been to look at them as a pan-Arab pheno­me­non with dif­fe­rent neigh­bo­ring coun­tries sup­porting each other in dif­fe­rent ways.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-5-p0">The eli­tes—in most cases the dic­ta­to­ri­al elite—of these coun­tries prop each other up, and this be­co­mes more dif­fi­cult if we can get them to focus on their own do­mestic is­su­es.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-6-p0">In­for­ma­ti­on pro­du­ced by the re­vo­lu­tio­na­ries in Egypt on how to con­duct a re­vo­lu­ti­on is now sprea­ding into Bah­rain.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-7-p0">So this is being pus­hed out.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-8-p0">We have pan-Arab ac­tivists sprea­ding, and there exists Wes­tern sup­port for these op­po­si­ti­on groups, or for the tra­di­tio­nal dic­ta­to­ri­al lea­dership.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-9-p0">And that sup­port can be af­fec­ted by ex­po­sing not just the in­ter­nal abu­ses of power on the part of the re­gime, but also by ex­po­sing the na­tu­re of the re­la­ti­ons­hip bet­ween the United Sta­tes and these dic­ta­tor­ships.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-10-p0">When the na­tu­re of this is ex­po­sed, we have a si­tua­ti­on much like what ac­tual­ly hap­pe­n­ed with Jo­seph Biden, the Vice Pre­si­dent of the United Sta­tes, who last year cal­led me a “hi-tech ter­ro­rist.” This year, he said that Mu­ba­rak was not a dic­ta­tor, but pres­u­m­a­b­ly a de­mo­crat, and that he should not stand down.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-11-p0">Look at how the be­ha­vi­or of Wa­shing­ton chan­ged with re­gard to Mu­ba­rak just be­fo­re he fell.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-12-p0">After we re­leased these ca­bles about the re­la­ti­ons­hip bet­ween the United Sta­tes and Mu­ba­rak in for­eign mi­li­ta­ry sub­si­dies and the FBI’s trai­ning of tor­tu­rers in Egypt, it was no lon­ger pos­si­ble for Biden to make these kinds of state­ments.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-13-p0">It be­ca­me com­ple­te­ly im­pos­si­ble, be­cau­se their own am­bas­sa­dors were say­ing, just the year be­fo­re, that Su­lei­man and Mu­ba­rak had been ex­tre­me­ly abu­si­ve to the Egyp­ti­an peop­le in so many ways—and that the United Sta­tes had been in­vol­ved in that abuse, in some way.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-57-14-p0">So, if you’re able to pull out re­gio­nal sup­port and Wes­tern sup­port, and the un­der­ground ac­tivists are good, and are sharing and sprea­ding in­for­ma­ti­on with each other, then I think we can ac­tual­ly get rid of quite a few of these re­gimes.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-59-4-p0">That’s been hap­pe­ning throughout the Arab world now—some of them are li­te­r­al­ly han­ding out cash, and land, and of­fe­ring ca­bi­net posts to some of the more li­be­ral forces in the coun­try.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-59-5-p0">They’ve been pul­ling elec­tion ti­me­ta­bles for­ward, say­ing they’ll re­sign at the next elec­tion—many in­te­res­ting and im­portant types of con­ces­si­ons.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-59-6-p0">So, alt­hough I think we will see a few more go down, in the end it ac­tual­ly doesn’t re­al­ly mat­ter whe­ther the lea­der is re­mo­ved or not.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-59-7-p0">What mat­ters is that the power struc­tu­re of the go­vern­ment chan­ges.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-1-p0">Right, they can keep their mon­arch.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-2-p0">In prac­tice, you may have a so­cie­ty that is clo­ser to what peop­le want, a so­cie­ty that’s much more ci­vi­li­zed.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-3-p0">But let me first qua­li­fy all that I’ve just said.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-4-p0">I’ve re­cei­ved re­ports from peop­le who have been on the ground in Egypt, in Bah­rain, and have come over and brie­fed me per­so­nal­ly on what’s hap­pe­ning.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-5-p0">And it seems very good that, for ex­amp­le, when Mu­ba­rak was re­mo­ved he was the head of a pa­tro­na­ge net­work that ex­ten­ded down into every po­si­ti­on in Egypt, to the chief of the la­wy­ers’ syn­di­ca­te to the gro­ce­ries in­dus­try, to par­ti­cu­lar peop­le in the army, and so forth.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-6-p0">So every in­sti­tu­ti­on and every city coun­cil had its own mini-re­vo­lu­ti­on after Mu­ba­rak was re­mo­ved.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-7-p0">I think that this chan­ge in the power struc­tu­res un­der­ne­ath will, to a large de­gree, con­fi­ne and cons­train whoever as­su­mes power later.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-8-p0">Still, with these re­vo­lu­ti­ons we have to be ca­re­ful not to end up with so­me­thing like the Oran­ge Re­vo­lu­ti­on, where you had li­be­ral forces, but ones that were being li­te­r­al­ly paid by the United Sta­tes and Wes­tern Eu­ro­pe.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-9-p0">They opened up and li­be­ra­li­zed the Ukrai­ne in im­portant ways, but the re­sult was that op­por­tu­nists in­si­de the coun­try rose up and op­por­tu­nists outs­ide the coun­try came in and re­al­ly de­s­troy­ed the so­ci­al fa­bric of the coun­try, lea­ding wi­t­hin five years to a back­lash that in­stal­led a much more So­viet-style pre­si­dent with close ties to Rus­sia.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-10-p0">These si­tua­ti­ons still need mo­ni­to­ring.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-11-p0">One of the do­cu­ments used by the re­vo­lu­tio­na­ries in Cairo is quite in­te­res­ting to con­sider.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-12-p0">After Mu­ba­rak fell, we wit­nessed an ex­tra­or­di­na­ry chan­ge in rhe­to­ric from Hil­la­ry Clin­ton and the White House, from “Mu­ba­rak is a great guy and he should stay,” to “Isn’t it great what the Egyp­ti­an peop­le have done?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-13-p0">And isn’t it great how the United Sta­tes did it for them?” Li­ke­wi­se, there is an idea that these great Ame­ri­can com­pa­nies, Face­book and Twit­ter, gave the Egyp­ti­an peop­le this re­vo­lu­ti­on and li­be­ra­ted Egypt.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-14-p0">But the most po­pu­lar guide for the re­vo­lu­tio­na­ries was a do­cu­ment that spre­ad throughout the soc­cer clubs in Egypt, which them­sel­ves were the most si­gni­fi­cant re­vo­lu­tio­na­ry com­mu­ni­ty groups.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-15-p0">If you read this do­cu­ment, you see that on the first page it says to be ca­re­ful not to use Twit­ter and Face­book as they are being mo­ni­to­red.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-16-p0">On the last page: do not use Twit­ter or Face­book.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-17-p0">That is the most po­pu­lar guide for the Egyp­ti­an re­vo­lu­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-61-18-p0">And then we see Hil­la­ry Clin­ton try­ing to say that this was a re­vo­lu­ti­on by Twit­ter and Face­book.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-63-4-p0">Media part­ners that we’ve worked with—such as Der Spie­gel, The New York Times, The Guar­di­an, El Pais, and Le Monde—have al­re­a­dy been in­cli­ned to pro­du­ce sto­ries cri­ti­cal of Iran, so they traw­led through the ca­bles to find bad sto­ries about Iran and have been pu­blis­hing them since De­cem­ber at a tre­men­dous pace.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-63-5-p0">Bey­ond pu­blis­hing the un­der­ly­ing ca­bles, we haven’t ac­tual­ly done any of our own work on Iran.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-63-6-p0">But this is ac­tual­ly be­cau­se the Wes­tern main­stream press is, as far as I can tell, in­spi­red to pro­du­ce bad sto­ries about Iran as a re­sult of geo­po­li­ti­cal in­flu­en­ces.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-63-7-p0">So we didn’t need to as­sist, while with Egypt we had to do all the work.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-63-8-p0">We’d given these Wes­tern pa­pers all the ma­te­ri­al, and they didn’t do a god­damn thing about Egypt.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-63-9-p0">Howe­ver, this chan­ged later on when we part­ne­red with The Te­le­graph, who lis­tened clo­se­ly to our pre­dic­tions.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-65-3-p0">It made them bra­ver, though it did not ent­i­re­ly work in the case of The New York Times.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-65-4-p0">For ex­amp­le, one of the sto­ries we found in the Af­ghan War Diary was from “Task Force 373,” a US Spe­cial Forces as­sas­si­na­ti­on squad.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-65-5-p0">Task Force 373 is working its way down an as­sas­si­na­ti­on list of some 2,000 peop­le for Af­gha­nis­tan, and the Kabul go­vern­ment is ra­ther un­hap­py about these ex­tra­ju­di­ci­al as­sas­si­na­ti­ons—there is no im­par­ti­al pro­ce­du­re for put­ting a name on the list or for ta­king a name off the list.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-65-7-p0">It’s sup­po­sed­ly a kill or cap­tu­re list.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-65-8-p0">But you can see from the ma­te­ri­al that we re­leased that about 50 per­cent of cases were just kill—there’s no op­ti­on to “cap­tu­re” when a drone drops a bomb on so­meo­ne.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-65-9-p0">And in some cases Task Force 373 kil­led in­no­cents, in­clu­ding one case where they at­ta­cked a school and kil­led seven child­ren and no bona fide tar­gets, and at­temp­ted to cover the whole thing up.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-67-3-p0">We’re still too young to look back and say, oh, this is so­me­thing we never ma­na­ged to do.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-67-4-p0">But there is one thing we tried to do and fai­led at, and it’s very in­te­res­ting.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-67-5-p0">So, it was my view early on that the whole of the exis­ting Fourth Es­ta­te was not big en­ough for the task of ma­king sense of in­for­ma­ti­on that hadn’t pre­vious­ly been pu­blic.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-67-6-p0">To take our most re­cent case as an ex­amp­le, all the jour­na­lists in the world would not be en­ough to make com­ple­te sense of the 400,000 do­cu­ments we re­leased about Iraq, and, of cour­se, they have other things to write about as well.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-67-7-p0">I al­ways knew this would be the case.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-67-8-p0">I was very con­fi­dent about ha­ving en­ough sour­ce ma­te­ri­al.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-67-9-p0">So what we wan­ted to do was to take all that vol­un­te­er labor that is spent on wri­ting about things that are not ter­ri­b­ly im­portant, and re­di­rect it to ma­te­ri­al that we re­leased, ma­te­ri­al that has a real po­ten­ti­al for chan­ge if peop­le as­sess it, ana­ly­ze it, con­textua­li­ze it, and push it back into local com­mu­nities.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-67-10-p0">I tried very hard to make that hap­pen, but it didn’t. I had loo­ked at all these peop­le wri­ting Wi­ki­pe­dia ar­ti­cles, and all these peop­le wri­ting blogs about the issue du jour, wha­te­ver that was, es­pe­cial­ly in re­la­ti­on to war and peace.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-67-11-p0">And I thought about the tre­men­dous amount of ef­fort that goes into that.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-67-12-p0">When some of these blog­gers are asked why they don’t do ori­gi­nal sto­ries, and why they don’t have opi­ni­on pie­ces and ana­ly­sis of media out­put, they say, “Well, we don’t have ori­gi­nal sour­ces so we can’t write ori­gi­nal ma­te­ri­al.” So, su­re­ly, ra­ther than write a Wi­ki­pe­dia ar­ti­cle on so­me­thing that would have no po­li­ti­cal in­flu­ence, the op­por­tu­ni­ty to write about a se­cret in­tel­li­gence re­port re­vea­led to the world at that very mo­ment would su­re­ly be ir­re­sis­ti­ble, or so I thought.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-68-1-p0">But I’ll give you an ex­amp­le to ex­plain what I found ins­tead.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-68-2-p0">I re­leased a se­cret in­tel­li­gence re­port from the US Army In­tel­li­gence on what hap­pe­n­ed in Fal­lu­jah in the first batt­le of Fal­lu­jah in 2004, and it loo­ked like a very good do­cu­ment—se­cret clas­si­fi­ca­ti­on la­bels all over it, nice maps, color, a good, com­bi­ned mi­li­ta­ry and po­li­ti­cal de­scrip­ti­on of what had hap­pe­n­ed, even Al Ja­ze­e­ra’s cri­ti­cal in­vol­ve­ment.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-68-3-p0">And there was ana­ly­sis of what the US should have done, which was to con­duct a po­li­ti­cal and psy­cho­lo­gi­cal shaping ope­ra­ti­on be­fo­re they went in.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-68-4-p0">In the case of Fal­lu­jah, some US Mi­li­ta­ry contrac­tors had been grab­bed and hung in the town, and the US re­s­pon­se gra­dual­ly be­ca­me an in­va­si­on of the town.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-68-5-p0">So, ra­ther than being a ca­re­ful­ly pre-plan­ned ope­ra­ti­on, it had been a con­ti­nu­al esca­la­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-68-6-p0">They hadn’t set up the ne­cessa­ry po­li­ti­cal and media fac­tors to sup­port the mi­li­ta­ry ob­jec­tive.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-68-7-p0">It was an ex­tre­me­ly in­te­res­ting do­cu­ment, and we sent it to 3,000 peop­le.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-68-8-p0">Not­hing ap­peared for five days.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-68-9-p0">Then, a small re­port by a fri­end of mine, Shaun Wa­ter­man at UPI, ap­peared as a news­wire, and then ano­ther one by a guy, Davis Isen­berg, who spends half his time at the Cato In­sti­tu­te, but pu­blis­hed this for the Asia Times.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-12-68-10-p0">But be­fo­re the UPI re­port, there was not­hing by any blog­gers, by any Wi­ki­pe­dia-type peop­le, by any lef­tist in­tel­lec­tu­als, by any Arab in­tel­lec­tu­als, not­hing.</span>
