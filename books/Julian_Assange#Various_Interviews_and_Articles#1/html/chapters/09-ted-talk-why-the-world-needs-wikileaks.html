        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-12-1-p0">So this is the Kroll Re­port.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-12-2-p0">This was a se­cret in­tel­li­gence re­port com­mis­sio­ned by the Ke­nyan go­vern­ment after its elec­tion in 2004.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-12-3-p0">Prior to 2004, Kenya was ruled by Da­ni­el arap Moi for about 18 years.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-12-4-p0">He was a soft dic­ta­tor of Kenya.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-12-5-p0">And when Ki­baki got into power -- through a co­ali­ti­on of forces that were try­ing to clean up cor­rup­ti­on in Kenya -- they com­mis­sio­ned this re­port, spent about two mil­li­on pounds on this and an as­so­cia­ted re­port.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-12-6-p0">And then the go­vern­ment sat on it and used it for po­li­ti­cal le­ver­age on Moi, who was the ri­chest man -- still is the ri­chest man -- in Kenya.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-12-7-p0">It's the Holy Grail of Ke­nyan jour­na­lism.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-12-8-p0">So I went there in 2007, and we ma­na­ged to get hold of this just prior to the elec­tion -- the na­tio­nal elec­tion, De­cem­ber 28.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-12-9-p0">When we re­leased that re­port, we did so three days after the new pre­si­dent, Ki­baki, had de­ci­ded to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out, Da­ni­el arap Moi, so this re­port then be­ca­me a dead al­ba­tross around Pre­si­dent Ki­baki's neck.</span>

      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-1-p0">So this is a samp­le of what we do sort of every day.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-2-p0">So late last year -- in No­vem­ber last year -- there was a se­ries of well blo­wouts in Al­ba­nia, like the well blo­wout in the Gulf of Me­xi­co, but not quite as big.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-3-p0">And we got a re­port -- a sort of en­gi­nee­ring ana­ly­sis into what hap­pe­n­ed -- say­ing that, in fact, se­cu­ri­ty guards from some rival, va­rious com­pe­ting oil firms had, in fact, par­ked trucks there and blown them up.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-4-p0">And part of the Al­ba­ni­an go­vern­ment was in this, etc., etc.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-5-p0">And the en­gi­nee­ring re­port had not­hing on the top of it, so it was an ex­tre­me­ly dif­fi­cult do­cu­ment for us.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-6-p0">We couldn't ve­ri­fy it be­cau­se we didn't know who wrote it and knew what it was about.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-7-p0">So we were kind of skep­ti­cal that maybe it was a com­pe­ting oil firm just sort of play­ing the issue up.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-8-p0">So under that basis, we put it out and said, "Look, we're skep­ti­cal about this thing.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-9-p0">We don't know, but what can we do?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-10-p0">The ma­te­ri­al looks good, it feels right, but we just can't ve­ri­fy it." And we then got a let­ter just this week from the com­pa­ny who wrote it, wan­ting to track down the sour­ce -- (Laugh­ter) say­ing, "Hey, we want to track down the sour­ce." And we were like, "Oh, tell us more.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-11-p0">What do­cu­ment is it, pre­cise­ly, you're tal­king about?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-12-p0">Can you show that you had legal aut­ho­ri­ty over that do­cu­ment?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-13-p0">Is it re­al­ly yours?" So they sent us this screen shot with the aut­hor in the Mi­cro­soft Word ID.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-14-p0">Yeah.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-15-p0">(Ap­plau­se) That's hap­pe­n­ed quite a lot though.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-45-16-p0">This is like one of our me­thods of iden­ti­fy­ing, of ve­ri­fy­ing, what a ma­te­ri­al is, is to try and get these guys to write let­ters.</span>
