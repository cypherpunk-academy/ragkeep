        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-2-1-p0">My ar­chi­ve now con­ta­ins over 2000 hours of in­ter­views re­cor­ded in many dif­fe­rent pla­ces, and I am con­stant­ly at­temp­t­ing to dis­co­ver new rules of the game, new ap­proa­ches to how an in­ter­view can work.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-2-2-p0">For an in­ter­view with Hans-Peter Feld­mann pu­blis­hed in­iti­al­ly in AnO­ther Ma­ga­zi­ne and then in book form, I emai­led him one ques­ti­on per day, and each of Feld­mann’s re­s­pon­ses would take the form of an image.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-2-3-p0">For my in­ter­view with Loui­se Bour­geois, I would send a ques­ti­on and she would email back a drawing.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-2-4-p0">When Ju­li­an came to my of­fice with Mark and Da­ni­el for our first mee­ting, we dis­cus­sed the idea of a dif­fe­rent for­mat with ques­ti­ons from ar­tists, and Ju­li­an liked this a lot, sug­gesting that the ar­tists send the ques­ti­ons as short vi­de­os so that he could see them.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-2-5-p0">We set the in­ter­view for two weeks later at 10 or 11 p.m., as we dis­co­ve­r­ed that we both work late at night.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-2-6-p0">Tra­ve­ling more than three hours from Lon­don on Sun­day, Fe­bru­ary 27, I ar­ri­ved at El­ling­ham Hall, the Geor­gi­an man­si­on near the Eas­tern coast of Eng­land that Vaug­han Smith of­fe­red Ju­li­an to use as his ad­dress for bail du­ring his UK ex­tra­di­ti­on hea­rings.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-2-7-p0">In the li­ving room of the pic­tures­que home he de­scri­bed to me as a “gol­den cage” we drank many cups of cof­fee and spoke until 3 a.m. about his life, his no­ma­dism, his early be­gin­nings and the in­ven­ti­on of Wi­ki­Leaks, his time in Egypt, Kenya, Ice­land, and other pla­ces, his sci­en­ti­fic back­ground, and the theo­re­ti­cal un­der­pin­nings of Wi­ki­Leaks.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-3-2-p0">I was not in­te­rested in his court case or pri­va­te life, but in his pu­blic work as the voice of Wi­ki­Leaks, and the ex­pe­ri­en­ces and phi­lo­so­phi­cal back­ground that in­forms such a mo­nu­men­tal­ly po­le­mi­cal pro­ject.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-5-1-p0">The Bour­baki were an an­ony­mous group of French ma­the­ma­ti­ci­ans who pu­blis­hed a se­ries of ma­the­ma­tics books over a pe­ri­od of about 20 years under the collec­tive al­l­onym Ni­co­las Bour­baki.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-5-2-p0">They kept their in­di­vi­du­al iden­ti­ties an­ony­mous, and their books are still re­gar­ded as some of the fi­nest math books ever pu­blis­hed in French.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-5-3-p0">In 2006, I saw that Wi­ki­Leaks nee­ded to be, if not com­ple­te­ly an­ony­mous, then pseu­do-an­ony­mous—ide­al­ly pu­blis­hing under a collec­tive al­l­onym such as Bour­baki.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-5-4-p0">First of all, as a young or­ga­niza­t­i­on pu­blis­hing very con­tro­ver­si­al ma­te­ri­al, we didn’t want to be more of a tar­get than we nee­ded to be.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-5-5-p0">While I was pu­bli­cly a mem­ber of the ad­vi­so­ry board, that is dif­fe­rent than being the edi­tor in chief or one of the prin­ci­pal wri­ters.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-5-6-p0">I also wan­ted to re­mo­ve ego as much as pos­si­ble from what we were doing, to make sure peop­le were wri­ting and con­duc­ting their work for re­a­sons other than ego.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-5-7-p0">Also, as an or­ga­niza­t­i­on that did not yet have a re­pu­ta­ti­on, we nee­ded a per­so­na­li­zed voice to quick­ly get a re­pu­ta­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-5-8-p0">If we pul­led our collec­tive ef­forts into a name like Jack Bour­baki, or ano­ther collec­tive al­l­onym, our per­so­na­li­ty would quick­ly gain a re­pu­ta­ti­on be­cau­se of the re­la­tive­ly high level of our out­put.</span>

      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-6-1-p0">But wi­t­hin a month of our co­m­ing to the pu­blic stage there was a leak of one of our in­ter­nal mai­ling lists by a New York ar­chi­tect named John Young, who had been in­vol­ved in his own pri­mi­ti­ve, but ag­gres­si­ve pu­blis­hing pro­ject.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-6-2-p0">John saw from the press pu­bli­ci­ty that Wi­ki­Leaks would be­co­me si­gni­fi­cant in the field and might threa­ten his own pro­ject.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-6-3-p0">But it was quite a reve­la­ti­on to have our own leak very early on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-6-4-p0">And I thought to mys­elf, well, this is very in­te­res­ting—now we get to taste our own me­di­ci­ne.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-6-5-p0">And ac­tual­ly, this me­di­ci­ne tas­ted quite nice, in that what I saw was a group of very com­mit­ted, idea­lis­tic peop­le whose in­ter­nal dia­lo­gue was even stron­ger than their ex­ter­nal dia­lo­gue.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-6-6-p0">So, there was no hy­po­cri­sy in what we were doing, pre­cise­ly the op­po­si­te—we were even more prin­ci­pled and idea­lis­tic in­ter­nal­ly than we were ex­ter­nal­ly.</span>

      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-7-1-p0">Early on, I al­re­a­dy had an exis­ting re­pu­ta­ti­on, and I spent that re­pu­ta­tio­nal ca­pi­tal to get vol­un­te­er labor from good peop­le.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-7-2-p0">But when the press star­ted snif­fing around, very cu­rious as to who some of the prin­ciple peop­le in this pro­ject were, some of my fri­ends, ra­ther un­for­t­u­n­a­te­ly, said, well, it’s Ju­li­an, and he de­ser­ves all the credit.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-7-3-p0">I could’ve shot them!</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-7-4-p0">And then I saw that, by try­ing to en­gi­neer a po­si­ti­on in which I was not seen as an aut­ho­ri­ty fi­gu­re for the or­ga­niza­t­i­on, we ended up with peop­le who were not in­vol­ved in the or­ga­niza­t­i­on at all clai­ming to re­pre­sent it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-7-5-p0">And so we star­ted suf­fe­ring from re­pu­ta­tio­nal op­por­tu­nism, which we had to stamp out.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-7-6-p0">We also grew more po­li­ti­cal­ly power­ful with many sup­por­ters all over the world.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-7-7-p0">So we no lon­ger nee­ded an­ony­mi­ty for our­sel­ves in quite the same way—I still nee­ded lo­ca­tio­nal an­ony­mi­ty for se­cu­ri­ty re­a­sons, but my name being known was not so im­portant anyhow, given that the in­for­ma­ti­on was al­re­a­dy floa­ting around for an­yo­ne who re­al­ly cared to look.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-9-3-p0">Up until the la­test pro­blem with the Pen­ta­gon, which star­ted around June/July of last year, it wasn’t a mat­ter of being on the run.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-9-4-p0">It was more about fol­lo­wing op­por­tu­ni­ty and en­su­ring that I wasn’t in one place long en­ough to allow for a pro­per sur­veil­lan­ce ope­ra­ti­on, which in­vol­ves get­ting in­si­de and in­stal­ling video ca­me­ras, mo­ni­to­ring all out­go­ing elec­tro­nic si­gnals, and so forth.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-2-p0">And the mi­li­ta­ry in­dus­tri­al com­plex has been broa­de­ning and ex­pan­ding its share of that pa­tro­na­ge sys­tem ag­gres­si­ve­ly.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-3-p0">There are now around 900,000 peop­le in the United Sta­tes that have top-se­cret se­cu­ri­ty cle­aran­ces.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-4-p0">Ten years ago, the Na­tio­nal Se­cu­ri­ty Agen­cy dealt with about six­teen pri­va­te contrac­tors.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-5-p0">The Na­tio­nal Se­cu­ri­ty Agen­cy is the big­gest spy agen­cy in the United Sta­tes, and its com­bi­ned bud­get is more than that of the FBI and CIA com­bi­ned, or at least it was around eight years ago when I had the last sta­tis­tic.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-6-p0">Now, it has over 1,000 contrac­tors.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-7-p0">Si­mi­lar­ly, US in­vol­ve­ment in Iraq crea­ted around 10,000 dif­fe­rent pri­va­te contrac­tors.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-8-p0">So the pa­tro­na­ge is now mo­ving into the pri­va­te sec­tor.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-9-p0">It’s less con­tai­ned than it was.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-10-p0">Its ten­ta­cles are sprea­ding into all walks of our so­cie­ty and the num­ber of peop­le who are con­nec­ted through fa­mi­ly and busi­ness re­la­ti­ons­hips, to that struc­tu­re, con­ti­nues to in­crea­se.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-11-p0">My guess is that so­me­thing like 30 to 40 per­cent of the US po­pu­la­ti­on is now eit­her di­rect­ly con­nec­ted to that struc­tu­re, or one step re­mo­ved, through fa­mi­ly and busi­ness re­la­ti­ons­hips.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-12-p0">In the past two years, US tax re­ve­nue has de­crea­sed ne­ar­ly 25 per­cent, while at the same time the amount of tax re­ve­nue flo­wing through to that sec­tor in the first year of Obama was around 6% to 7%—the amount of money being soa­ked up by this sec­tor is in­cre­a­sing.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-13-p0">So that shows you that as a pa­tro­na­ge net­work it is in­cre­a­sing in its power, be­cau­se it’s star­ting to eat up more of the pie, com­pa­red to other groups.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-14-p0">That’s a real pro­blem for the United Sta­tes.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-15-p0">There’s a vast shadow state of pri­va­te com­pa­nies hoo­ked into the se­crecy sys­tem, into the na­tio­nal se­cu­ri­ty sys­tem, and an ever-ex­pan­ding num­ber of new go­vern­ment bu­reau­cra­cies as well.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-16-p0">It’s very worry­ing that in the United Sta­tes, that area is hea­ding towards a Pu­ti­niza­t­i­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-41-17-p0">What Putin and the silo­vi­ki did to Rus­sia, that sys­tem is doing to the United Sta­tes.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-44-1-p0">And we can look at so­me­thing like when it was an­noun­ced that Knopf had si­gned an 800,000 dol­lars deal for my book to be pu­blis­hed in the US, and I sta­ted that I would use a por­ti­on of this money to keep Wi­ki­Leaks af­loat.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-44-2-p0">Peter T. King, the Chair­man of the Home­land Se­cu­ri­ty Com­mit­tee—a power­ful po­si­ti­on in the United Sta­tes Con­gress—wrote to Ti­mo­thy C. Geith­ner, the US Tre­a­su­ry Se­creta­ry, and per­so­nal­ly asked him to add Ju­li­an Ass­an­ge and Wi­ki­Leaks as an or­ga­niza­t­i­on to the US Spe­cial­ly De­si­gna­ted Na­tio­nals List, which is the US em­bar­go list.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-44-3-p0">So in the way that Cuba is em­bar­go­ed from all eco­no­mic in­ter­ac­tion with any US ci­ti­zen under pe­nal­ty of cri­mi­nal ac­tion, I, per­so­nal­ly, would be em­bar­go­ed from any eco­no­mic in­ter­ac­tion with any US ci­ti­zen, and so would Wi­ki­Leaks.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-44-4-p0">Ti­mo­thy C. Geith­ner then sma­cked this re­quest back wi­t­hin 48 hours and de­nied it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-44-5-p0">It’s very unusu­al.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-44-6-p0">Geith­ner is right from the elite of the Wall Street pa­tro­na­ge net­work.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-44-7-p0">And as US Tre­a­su­ry Se­creta­ry, he’s re­mai­ned there.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-44-8-p0">In terms of a di­plo­ma­tic si­gnal, that was very in­te­res­ting.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-44-9-p0">Ass a pu­re­ly tech­no­cra­tic re­s­pon­se, Geith­ner could have sat on it for two, three weeks, to then re­ject or ac­cept it for tech­ni­cal re­a­sons.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-44-10-p0">To knock it back so quick­ly is to say, no, we’re de­li­be­ra­te­ly sen­ding a si­gnal that we don’t want that to hap­pen.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-46-1-p0">This is an in­te­res­ting ques­ti­on, be­cau­se when the US re­vo­lu­tio­na­ry go­vern­ment first came into power, it did pu­blish all its di­plo­ma­tic ne­go­tia­ti­ons wi­t­hin a month of their ha­ving taken place.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-46-2-p0">So, in fact, ide­al­ly, all di­plo­ma­tic com­mu­ni­ca­ti­ons would be open.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-46-5-p0">I think the new di­plo­ma­tic stan­dard should be to make all these things as open as pos­si­ble.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-46-6-p0">There’s a sa­cri­fice that we’re not ma­king, which is to sup­po­se that if peop­le can’t con­ce­al things through se­crecy, they can con­ce­al them through com­ple­xi­ty ins­tead.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-46-7-p0">And you can see that in the ap­pal­ling po­li­ti­cal­ly cor­rect bu­reau­cra­tic lan­gua­ge how this dy­na­mic is used in some in­sti­tu­ti­ons that are held to rou­ti­ne pu­blic ac­coun­ta­bi­li­ty, where there is no se­crecy.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-46-8-p0">Ins­tead, they dis­tort their lan­gua­ge and con­ce­al things through com­ple­xi­ty or wea­sel words.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-46-9-p0">But if you had to make a stand, it’s not clear to me which would be the bet­ter out­co­me.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-46-10-p0">The pe­rils of se­cret com­mu­ni­ca­ti­ons are so ap­pal­ling that I sus­pect we would be bet­ter off suf­fe­ring from po­li­ti­cal cor­rect­ness and from in­crea­sed com­ple­xi­ty.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-46-11-p0">But as it’s sort of a short-term thing, given the re­al­po­li­tik, it makes sense to keep things se­cret from time to time.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-54-3-p0">In­tel­lec­tu­al works are in­her­ent­ly dif­fe­rent from other eco­no­mic works, which have built-in sc­ar­ci­ty value.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-54-6-p0">There is a com­ple­te­ly dif­fe­rent kind of eco­no­my as­so­cia­ted with clo­ne­able ma­te­ri­al, ma­te­ri­al that can’t have any forced sc­ar­ci­ty.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-54-7-p0">For ex­amp­le, E=mc² con­ti­nues to be im­portant in all sorts of ways, yet it has a sc­ar­ci­ty of zero.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-54-8-p0">There is an in­fi­ni­te sup­p­ly of E=mc², so it should pro­bab­ly be a pu­blic good, and in some cases we re­co­gni­ze this.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-54-9-p0">With sci­en­ti­fic pa­pers, we un­der­stand that once so­me­thing in sci­ence has been dis­co­ve­r­ed to be im­portant, it spreads very quick­ly.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-54-10-p0">And it is im­pos­si­ble to pro­fit from its sc­ar­ci­ty value, or to even keep it sc­ar­ce.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-54-11-p0">It very quick­ly be­co­mes an in­fi­ni­te good, and there’s an in­fi­ni­te sup­p­ly of it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-54-12-p0">Ass a re­sult, suc­cess­ful so­cie­ties have set up me­cha­nisms to fund sci­en­tists who pro­du­ce those very im­portant in­fi­ni­te goods.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-54-13-p0">Per­haps the same could be true for jour­na­lism, but the most im­portant jour­na­lism is jour­na­lism that holds go­vern­ment to ac­count, and holds power­ful or­ga­niza­t­i­ons to ac­count.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-54-14-p0">And there is no si­gni­fi­cant tra­di­ti­on anyw­he­re in the world of state-fun­ded, ag­gres­si­ve, in­ves­ti­ga­ti­ve jour­na­lism—this has al­ways been fun­ded by re­a­ders or ad­ver­ti­sers, which is easy to un­der­stand.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-54-17-p0">Maybe one could spe­ci­fy in a con­sti­tu­ti­on that some taxes must go toward this, but then there would need to be a way to ad­mi­nis­ter how this tax, if even collec­ted, is dis­pen­s­ed.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-54-18-p0">That be­co­mes a po­li­ti­cal func­tion, suf­fe­ring from all the pro­blems po­li­ti­cal func­tions have.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-62-8-p0">From this, we can see, on one hand, ex­tra­or­di­na­ry hy­po­cri­sy from the ent­i­re White House with re­gard to the im­port­an­ce of the free­dom of speech, and, on the other hand, a be­tra­y­al of those state­ments—an awful be­tra­y­al of the va­lues of the US Re­vo­lu­ti­on.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-62-9-p0">In spite of this, when such a quan­ti­ty of qua­li­ty in­for­ma­ti­on is re­leased, we have the op­por­tu­ni­ty to ratt­le this struc­tu­re en­ough that we have a chan­ce of achie­ving some si­gni­fi­cant re­forms.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-77-1-p0">Of cour­se.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-77-2-p0">I wouldn’t be doing this in­ter­view if I didn’t think that art could play a role in sup­porting us.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-77-3-p0">At the mo­ment, the ideo­lo­gi­cal front line has been drawn, and we’re now en­ga­ged in bit­ter trench war­fa­re, in­so­far as the main­stream press is con­cer­ned.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-77-4-p0">We have a large num­ber of peop­le on the outs­ide, there are a large num­ber of op­po­n­ents, and this front line takes a lot of en­er­gy to move.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-77-5-p0">The press has an in­flu­ence on the bulk of the po­pu­la­ti­on, but ac­tual­ly there are pla­ces where there are no front lines, yet.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-77-6-p0">The art world has a way of co­m­ing through in a more in­di­rect man­ner, pul­ling on peop­le’s emo­ti­ons in a way they weren’t ex­pec­ting.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-77-7-p0">Si­mi­lar­ly, just in terms of prac­tical con­nec­tions, the art world is able to reach power­ful peop­le through the back door, through their sons and daugh­ters, through their wives, through their grand­mo­thers, and through mo­ments when they’re least ex­pec­ting it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-77-8-p0">In this way, I be­lie­ve that if the art world is able to di­still some of the im­portant va­lues of what we’re doing, and the les­sons to be lear­ned from the op­po­si­ti­on to what we’re doing, and pre­sent it in such a way that it calls on the bet­ter va­lues of these peop­le, or the va­lues that they aspi­re to, then this is a psy­cho­lo­gi­cal in­road into par­ti­cu­lar sec­tions of the cul­tu­re that are con­nec­ted to peop­le who op­po­se us and who would sup­port us, but who do not yet.</span>

      <p class="book-paragraph-text">
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-1-p0">They’re two very good ques­ti­ons, ac­tual­ly.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-2-p0">Un­ex­pec­ted.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-3-p0">I have read that Žižek piece.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-4-p0">I ac­tual­ly am ra­ther fond of Žižek, but that piece was fa­ci­le.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-5-p0">I had the im­pres­si­on that he ac­tual­ly doesn’t know much about the si­tua­ti­on and was re­spon­ding to mar­ket de­mand and wri­ting quick­ly.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-6-p0">So I was struck when I saw a video of a lec­tu­re by Žižek—not just by his cu­rious­ly au­tis­tic lec­tu­ring style in which he keeps pul­ling at his t-shirt, but ra­ther ex­act­ly the same im­pres­si­on that I had.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-7-p0">Do­nald Rums­feld said that there were known knowns, known un­k­nowns, and un­k­nown un­k­nowns.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-8-p0">When I heard Rums­feld say this, I im­me­dia­te­ly said, well, he’s mis­sed one per­mu­ta­ti­on, which is that there are un­k­nown knowns.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-9-p0">Žižek also spot­ted this, though it could be true that an­yo­ne who’s had some lo­gi­cal math back­ground would.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-10-p0">This fear of the Joker that Žižek comes up with is ty­pi­cal­ly of a sort of shal­low main­stream media myth­ma­king, some James Bond vil­lain fi­gu­re.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-11-p0">There’s so much de­mand for in­for­ma­ti­on about us, and about me, at the same time as there are also such strong forces in­flu­en­cing news con­tent in par­ti­cu­lar di­rec­tions—not in some sort of con­spi­ra­to­ri­al sense, with the White House brin­ging in key edi­tors to tell them to write so­me­thing, alt­hough that ac­tual­ly does hap­pen in re­la­ti­on to na­tio­nal se­cu­ri­ty re­por­ta­ge, and has hap­pe­n­ed to us.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-12-p0">Ra­ther, the ge­ne­ral ma­lai­se of the power­ful spreads down into these large main­stream media groups be­cau­se they are so close to power, and it tra­vels through edi­tors and jour­na­lists all the way down into the ge­ne­ral com­mu­ni­ty.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-13-p0">That, com­bi­ned with de­mand for in­for­ma­ti­on about us, which we do not serve, re­sults in peop­le wri­ting, reinter­pre­ting, in­ven­ting, or try­ing to come up with in­for­ma­ti­on about us.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-14-p0">That then starts to be whip­ped around, cut and pas­ted, edi­ted and ree­di­ted.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-15-p0">The end re­sult of this in­for­ma­ti­on cy­cling is a game of te­le­pho­ne that re­veals the in­ter­nal con­tours of the media eco­no­my, the in­ter­nal con­tours of jour­na­lists’ minds, and the in­ter­nal con­tours of po­li­ti­cal pres­su­re upon the media eco­no­my.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-16-p0">Ul­ti­mate­ly, it crea­tes myths.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-17-p0">It takes small fea­tures and makes them large.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-18-p0">It takes other large fea­tures and makes them small.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-19-p0">When you’re ac­tual­ly in the heat of it yours­elf, you be­co­me very aware of it, be­cau­se you know what re­al­ly hap­pe­n­ed, be­cau­se you were there.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-80-20-p0">To then see the level of dis­tor­ti­on grow and grow and grow on its own wi­thout any fresh input be­co­mes re­al­ly quite an in­te­res­ting pro­cess to ob­ser­ve.</span>
