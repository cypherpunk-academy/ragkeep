        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-2-2-p0">I was in­vol­ved in 2007 and 2008 in loo­king at what was hap­pe­ning to Iran, and from that pro­cess I’m fully aware of some of the pres­su­res that were on Tom.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-2-3-p0">A lot of peop­le did a lot of good work—per­haps the most im­portant was Tom Fin­gar’s, try­ing to cor­rect the mo­ve­ment towards war with Iran based on lies.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-2-4-p0">It’s in­credi­b­le to think back: only in 2003 the worst mo­dern de­cep­ti­on of the Wes­tern world oc­cur­red, where we went to war in Iraq based on lies.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-2-5-p0">Over 100,000 peop­le were kil­led and mil­li­ons of Iraqi re­fu­gees dis­pla­ced.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-2-6-p0">Just three years later, the drums for war with Iran were being whip­ped up—not just in the United Sta­tes, but also in this coun­try.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-2-7-p0">It’s thanks to jour­na­lists and trut­h­ful in­si­ders like Tom, and to sour­ces and the sour­ces for jour­na­lists, that that war hasn’t hap­pe­n­ed yet.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-3-2-p0">In those rules there was a sec­tion ap­pa­r­ent­ly de­si­gned—or at least per­mit­ted—for a bor­der skir­mish to start up, per­mit­ting US tro­ops to go into Iran under a va­rie­ty of cir­cum­stan­ces.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-4-1-p0">At the time there were dis­pu­tes in the Gulf with ships ap­proa­ching one ano­ther—a very hea­ted mo­ment—and the US main­stream media and the White House were ram­ping up any litt­le small in­ci­dent.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-4-2-p0">One of our sour­ces pro­vi­ded us with those clas­si­fied Rules of En­ga­ge­ment.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-4-3-p0">We pu­blis­hed them in a deal we set up with the New York Times to get grea­ter im­pact.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-4-4-p0">Ass a re­sult, the Ira­ni­an go­vern­ment held a press con­fe­rence and said: don’t you dare come over into our ter­ri­to­ry like that.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-4-5-p0">We then got hold of the next edi­ti­on of these clas­si­fied Rules of En­ga­ge­ment and that part had been re­mo­ved.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-1-p0">Wi­ki­leaks is not an or­ga­niza­t­i­on that hates in­tel­li­gence agen­cies—far from it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-2-p0">At its very base, the idea of in­tel­li­gence is an op­ti­mis­tic one: that one can un­der­stand the world, that one can apply in­tel­li­gence to un­der­stand.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-3-p0">The pro­blem is the cor­rup­ti­on of those agen­cies, and that cor­rup­ti­on comes about be­cau­se of se­crecy.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-4-p0">When Tom spoke about the im­pro­ved pro­cess he put down—and I be­lie­ve him, that it’s a si­gni­fi­cant im­pro­ve­ment—it all rests upon one thing: the abili­ty of peop­le in those agen­cies to get out in­for­ma­ti­on to the pu­blic when those pro­ces­ses are not fol­lo­wed.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-5-p0">We might have de­po­li­ti­ci­zed ana­lysts working in in­tel­li­gence agen­cies who, to all in­tents and pur­po­ses, are mere ro­bots—per­fect ma­chi­nes with per­fect ac­cu­ra­cy.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-6-p0">They’re tas­ked, they ana­ly­ze, they pass up in­for­ma­ti­on hig­her up the food chain.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-7-p0">But what if, in Tom’s case for ex­amp­le, his Na­tio­nal In­tel­li­gence Esti­ma­te—what if there was not a thre­at that it would be re­leased?</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-8-p0">Our sour­ces say that the White House knew that if it did not re­lease a ver­si­on im­me­dia­te­ly, ano­ther ver­si­on would be re­leased, and the White House would have to come se­cond, and its op­po­n­ents would have their spin on it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-9-p0">So the White House wan­ted to get their spin on it first.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-10-p0">It’s only through this pres­su­re of pro­du­cing ana­ly­ti­cal pro­duct to the pu­blic that these sorts of agen­cies are kept ho­nest and don’t be­co­me sim­ply ro­bots—per­haps drawing the bow too far, but some kind of Hit­ler’s wil­ling exe­cu­tio­ners: mere peop­le who act as ro­bots, who are told to carry out a task and do it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-11-p0">That is not en­ough.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-12-p0">It is not en­ough to agree to carry out a task for su­pe­ri­ors—that is the Nu­rem­berg de­fen­se.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-5-13-p0">We must all look to our­sel­ves and un­der­stand whe­ther what we are doing is right—not just ac­cor­ding to the views of our su­pe­ri­ors, but ac­cor­ding to the long view of his­to­ry, ac­cor­ding to human rights, and to our fee­lings of com­pas­si­on, if we have any.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-8-5-p0">That pro­du­ces an at­mo­s­phe­re of in­ten­se fear—an at­mo­s­phe­re where they think there is a war—and as a re­sult we all know that in Great Bri­tain, in World War I, they im­pri­so­ned Bertrand Rus­sell for ex­amp­le, and in World War II there were si­mi­lar abu­ses.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-21-8-6-p0">This at­mo­s­phe­re means that the human rights abu­ses we claim about Iran—human rights abu­ses that are cor­rect­ly loo­ked into—have very litt­le chan­ce of re­so­lu­ti­on, be­cau­se the lea­dership of that coun­try is so ter­ri­fied about being in­va­ded.</span>
