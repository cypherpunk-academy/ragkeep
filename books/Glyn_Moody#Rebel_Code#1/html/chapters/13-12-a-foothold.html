        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-2-2-p0">That backing was pro­vi­ded, and in the most un­e­qui­vo­cal man­ner, by the bluest of blue chip com­pa­nies: IBM an­noun­ced on 22 June 1998 that it would ship the Apa­che Web ser­ver with the IBM Web­S­phe­re Ap­p­li­ca­ti­on Ser­ver, a key com­po­nent of its Web­S­phe­re pro­duct fa­mi­ly, and offer “com­mer­ci­al, en­t­er­pri­se-level sup­port” for the free soft­ware.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-10-2-p0">“Ba­si­cal­ly 90 per­cent of the mar­ket was con­cen­tra­ted in three Web ser­vers”—from Mi­cro­soft, Net­scape, and Apa­che.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-10-3-p0">A negli­gi­b­le mar­ket share meant that it was dif­fi­cult—and ex­pen­si­ve—to find staff who were trai­ned to use IBM’s so­lu­ti­ons; this, in turn, meant that IBM’s broa­der Web of­fe­ring, which be­ca­me the Web­S­phe­re pro­duct line, would be dif­fi­cult to sell against com­pe­ti­ti­ve so­lu­ti­ons based on more po­pu­lar Web ser­vers.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-65-2-p0">Ass Miner ex­plains, the cor­po­ra­te ap­proach was “once you do so­me­thing, you ba­si­cal­ly do it com­ple­te­ly.” When Ora­cle de­li­ve­r­ed the final ver­si­on of its Ora­cle8 da­ta­ba­se for GNU/Linux on 7 Oc­to­ber 1998, it also laun­ched Ora­cle Ap­p­li­ca­ti­on Ser­ver.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-65-3-p0">The fol­lo­wing year, the com­pa­ny not only re­leased its WebDB pro­duct, a “da­ta­ba­se-powe­r­ed Web pu­blis­hing tool for end users,” for GNU/Linux but set up an ent­i­re busi­ness unit de­di­ca­ted to “de­ve­lop, mar­ket and sup­port Linux soft­ware.” A press re­lease ex­plai­ned that Ora­cle’s pro­ducts had “re­cei­ved a pheno­me­nal re­s­pon­se from the Linux mar­ket, es­ta­blis­hing Ora­cle as an en­t­er­pri­se soft­ware lea­der on Linux with more than 50,000 de­ve­l­o­pers and 800 cust­o­m­ers.”</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-66-2-p0">This was bols­te­red even fur­ther when the Ger­man com­pa­ny SAP an­noun­ced in March 1999 that it would be porting its en­t­er­pri­se re­sour­ce plan­ning (ERP) soft­ware R/3. The SAP press re­lease quo­ted Hasso Platt­ner, co­ch­air­man and CEO of SAP as say­ing, “We have re­cei­ved a si­gni­fi­cant num­ber of se­rious cust­o­m­er re­quests for R/3 on Linux over the past year.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-67-2-p0">On top of the basic R/3 plat­form run soft­ware mo­du­les that hand­le ge­ne­ric cor­po­ra­te tasks such as pay­roll and human re­sour­ces, as well as the spe­cia­li­zed re­qui­re­ments of in­dus­try sec­tors such as ae­ro­s­pace, au­to­mo­ti­ve, ban­king, che­mi­cal, oil and gas, etc.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-67-4-p0">More than half of the world’s top 500 com­pa­nies use SAP soft­ware.” Mi­cro­soft may power the world’s front of­fices with its Of­fice suite on Win­dows, but be­hind this desk­top ve­neer, SAP pro­vi­des the core func­tions that keep com­pa­nies run­ning.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-67-5-p0">The an­noun­ce­ment of the port of SAP R/3 to GNU/Linux was in some ways the cul­mi­na­ti­on of the gro­wing sup­port for open sour­ce that had begun ba­re­ly a year be­fo­re with Net­scape’s dra­ma­tic move.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-70-2-p0">Just as SAP’s an­noun­ce­ment that it would be porting R/3 re­pre­sen­ted the crow­ning glory for the GNU/Linux mo­ve­ment as a whole, a sign that it had at last and in­ar­gu­ab­ly ar­ri­ved in the en­t­er­pri­se, so SAP’s choice of Red Hat was near en­ough an of­fi­ci­al en­dor­se­ment of it as the pre­fer­red dis­tri­bu­ti­on for cor­po­ra­te use.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-71-4-p0">Quite right­ly, they saw this as a si­gni­fi­cant strike against Mi­cro­soft, Intel’s “part­ner” in the Win­tel duo­po­ly that had ef­fec­tive­ly ruled the com­pu­ting world for so many years.</span>
