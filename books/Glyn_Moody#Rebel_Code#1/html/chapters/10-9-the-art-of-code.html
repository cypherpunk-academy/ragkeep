McVoy was stee­ped in the main­stream Unix tra­di­ti­on, ha­ving worked first for The Santa Cruz Ope­ra­ti­on (SCO)—which later bought Unix from No­vell—and then for Sun, in both its soft­ware and hard­ware di­vi­si­ons.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-2-3-p0">This work ex­pe­ri­ence gave him a depth of prac­tical know­ledge in how the soft­ware in­dus­try func­tio­ned that few others in the GNU/Linux mo­ve­ment could match.</span>
