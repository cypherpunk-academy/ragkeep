        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-1-1-p0">WHEN LINUS EN­COUN­TE­RED UNIX in the fall of 1990, Ri­chard Stall­man’s great GNU pro­ject, begun six years be­fo­re, was al­most com­ple­te.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-1-2-p0">The one cru­ci­al ele­ment that was still lacking, the ker­nel, was under de­ve­lop­ment in the form of the GNU Hurd—the heart of Stall­man’s ope­ra­ting sys­tem.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-1-3-p0">For Stall­man, this delay was re­g­ret­ta­ble but not se­rious; it was more im­portant that most ele­ments of his free Unix-like sys­tem were now avail­able and that the mis­sing piece of the puz­zle was on its way.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-1-4-p0">This was cold com­fort for Linus, who wan­ted to run his own copy of Unix im­me­dia­te­ly, not in a few years’ time when the GNU Hurd was fi­nis­hed.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-1-5-p0">The more he and Lars Wir­ze­ni­us lear­ned about Unix, the more they liked it.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-3-2-p0">“One of the things that we dis­cus­sed [was that] we might need to ac­tual­ly write the Unix our­sel­ves be­cau­se the com­mer­ci­al ones were re­al­ly ex­pen­si­ve,” Wir­ze­ni­us says, but adds, “that was a joke, es­pe­cial­ly from my side; I’m not quite as good a pro­gram­mer as Linus is.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-3-3-p0">It’s not so­me­thing you de­ci­de–‘this week I will write an ope­ra­ting sys­tem.’” The jest pro­ved truer than eit­her could have ima­gi­ned.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-4-1-p0">For­t­u­n­a­te­ly, in ad­di­ti­on to whet­ting his ap­pe­ti­te for Unix, Linus’s stu­dies that fall pro­vi­ded him with a way to ac­qui­re it.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-4-2-p0">He re­calls that “one of the cour­se books was Ope­ra­ting Sys­tems: De­sign and Im­ple­men­ta­ti­on.” The book came with its own il­lus­tra­ti­ve soft­ware, which was unusu­al.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-4-3-p0">Cal­led Minix, it had been writ­ten to teach stu­dents how an ope­ra­ting sys­tem worked through ex­ami­ning its sour­ce code.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-4-4-p0">Linus found that Minix was es­sen­ti­al­ly a Unix-like sys­tem that ran on a PC.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-4-5-p0">He could not know then that not only would it pro­vi­de him with the scaf­fol­ding for buil­ding his own PC-based Unix ker­nel, Linux, but it would also fo­res­ha­dow many of the tech­ni­ques and even much of the de­ve­lop­ment his­to­ry of that sys­tem.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-5-1-p0">Minix was writ­ten by the same An­d­rew Ta­nen­baum who had re­buf­fed Ri­chard Stall­man’s over­tu­res in 1984 when Stall­man was se­ar­ching for a com­pi­ler and who pro­vo­ked Stall­man into wri­ting GCC.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-5-2-p0">De­s­pi­te this in­au­s­pi­cious start, Ta­nen­baum says Stall­man had later sug­gested to him that Minix could pro­vi­de the mis­sing ker­nel of the other­wi­se com­ple­te GNU sys­tem.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-5-3-p0">“He ap­proa­ched me a coup­le of times,” Ta­nen­baum says, “but he had all these con­di­ti­ons; it’s got to be this, and it’s got to be that.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-7-2-p0">Linus em­pha­si­zed later that “if the GNU ker­nel had been ready”— for ex­amp­le, through a form of Minix–when he was cas­ting around for his own copy of Unix, “I’d not have bo­the­red to even start my [Linux] pro­ject.” But Ta­nen­baum said no, and ins­tead of nip­ping Linux in the bud, Minix play­ed a fun­da­men­tal role in hel­ping it ger­mi­na­te and flower.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-9-1-p0">In 1979, ten years after Unix was first crea­ted, Ver­si­on 7 of the sys­tem was re­leased by AT&#x26;T. Ver­si­on 7 was of note for se­veral re­a­sons; for ex­amp­le, it was the first Unix to be por­ted to (trans­la­ted for use on) an Intel pro­ces­sor, the 8086, a slight­ly more power­ful ver­si­on of the 8088 chip later used in the first IBM PC.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-9-2-p0">Xenix, as it was cal­led, was the joint pro­ject of two com­pa­nies.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-9-3-p0">One was The Santa Cruz Ope­ra­ti­on, bet­ter known today as SCO (and later the owner of Unix).</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-9-4-p0">The other was Mi­cro­soft.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-9-5-p0">It is litt­le known today that one year be­fo­re Mi­cro­soft had laun­ched MS-DOS in 1981, it had al­re­a­dy brought out a PC ver­si­on of Unix.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-9-6-p0">But the exis­tence of Xenix, never a po­pu­lar pro­duct, makes the cur­rent chal­len­ge from sys­tems based around Linux pi­quant, to say the least.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-162-1-p0">Short­ly after the “Linux is ob­so­le­te” fla­me­fest, Linus stop­ped pos­ting al­most al­to­ge­ther in the comp.os.minix news­group, not be­cau­se he might have felt it in­ap­pro­pria­te to con­ti­nue to pedd­le Linux there, and not even be­cau­se he was of­fen­ded by Ta­nen­baum.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-162-2-p0">It was sim­ply that he had his own news­group now: alt.os.linux.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-162-3-p0">This was in the “un­of­fi­ci­al” alt Use­net hier­ar­chy, but in due cour­se it would turn into the “of­fi­ci­al” comp.os.linux, fully the equal of Ta­nen­baum’s comp.os.minix.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-163-1-p0">Later, in his 1992 Linux News in­ter­view, he said: “I have to admit to a very un­be­co­m­ing (but un­der­stan­da­ble, I hope) fee­ling of glee when I saw that [comp.os.]linux had fi­nal­ly more re­a­ders than [comp.os.] minix.” More re­a­ders, that is, than a news­group that had once been read avid­ly by 40,000 peop­le.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-164-3-p0">Some­bo­dy was as­king about GCC for Minix, which was where it had all begun in that first mes­sa­ge of 29 March 1991: “How did Linus get the GCC li­bra­ry to work with MINIX, and add sup­port to his own sys­tem calls and the like?” the wri­ter asked.</span>
