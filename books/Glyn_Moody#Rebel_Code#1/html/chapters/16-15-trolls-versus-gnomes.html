        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-77-2-p0">Of cour­se, the pu­rist wing of free soft­ware is not against com­mer­ci­al soft­ware as such, only pro­prieta­ry code.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-77-3-p0">And the ex­amp­le of Cyg­nus has shown that it is pos­si­ble to crea­te a high­ly suc­cess­ful com­pa­ny based on GNU GPL soft­ware.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-16-77-4-p0">De Icaza says he spoke to Mi­cha­el Tie­mann, one of the foun­ders of Cyg­nus, when set­ting up his com­pa­ny, Helix Code, with fel­low ha­cker Nat Fried­man, as well as to Red Hat’s Bob Young.</span>
