        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-2-2-p0">“I re­al­ly don’t keep up at all, al­most,” he said in 1996.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-2-3-p0">“I’m so ker­nel-cen­te­red, I re­al­ly don’t even care tech­ni­cal­ly about any pa­cka­ging”—the slight­ly dis­pa­ra­ging way ha­ckers ty­pi­cal­ly re­gard dis­tri­bu­ti­ons.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-2-4-p0">The main things that in­te­rested him about the gro­wing com­mer­cia­liza­t­i­on of his ker­nel were the pos­si­ble tech­ni­cal be­ne­fits it might bring.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-2-5-p0">“I don’t care about the mar­ket per se,” Linus said, “but I find it very in­te­res­ting to see Linux used in dif­fe­rent pla­ces.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-2-6-p0">Be­cau­se I think that’s how Linux should be used.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-2-7-p0">Not ne­ces­sa­ri­ly should [it] be used in com­mer­ci­al pla­ces, but Linux should be able to be used in those pla­ces, too.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-2-8-p0">I think get­ting more and dif­fe­rent mar­kets shows you the weak­nes­ses bet­ter of a sys­tem, so I ex­pect to get some feed­back re­la­ted to these is­su­es.” De­s­pi­te this un­wa­ver­ing con­cen­tra­ti­on on mil­king every op­por­tu­ni­ty to im­pro­ve his code, he, too, gra­dual­ly began to wage his own mar­ke­ting cam­pai­gn.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-3-3-p0">“I said ‘no’ to an in­vi­ta­ti­on to Ma­drid,” he says; this was “some Unix con­fe­rence” in spring 1993.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-3-4-p0">“Linux wasn’t re­al­ly well known,” he ex­plains, “but it was star­ting to be so­me­thing that some peop­le tal­ked about.” And yet, “I re­al­ly wan­ted to go,” he says, “I’d never been in Spain, but I was so ner­vous about gi­ving a talk there.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-5-3-p0">Hall had never heard of GNU/Linux until then, but a col­le­ague, Kurt Reis­ler, had con­vin­ced him to fund Linus’s trip.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-5-4-p0">Ass Hall wrote in an ar­ti­cle that ap­peared in the Oc­to­ber 1995 issue of <em>Linux Jour­nal</em>, “I had my doubts about this fun­ding as Kurt strugg­led to get Linux in­stal­led on that first PC, but after some able as­sis­tan­ce from Linus, he did get it working.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-5-5-p0">I had my first look at the ope­ra­ting sys­tem run­ning, and in less than ten mi­nu­tes I had con­vin­ced mys­elf that ‘this was Unix en­ough for me.’”</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-6-2-p0">The idea was that Linus would port Linux to this ar­chi­tec­tu­re, which was com­ple­te­ly dif­fe­rent from that of the Intel chips in or­di­na­ry PCs.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-75-3-p0">The de­ve­lop­ment pro­cess that had evol­ved over the pre­vious five years was cen­te­red on him so ab­so­lu­tely that even his smal­lest de­ci­si­ons were felt throughout the ent­i­re mo­ve­ment; this made his choice of com­pa­ny to work for cri­ti­cal, as his clo­sing re­mark in­di­ca­tes.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-75-4-p0">He ex­plai­ned at the end of 1996, “I wan­ted to do so­me­thing that wasn’t di­rect­ly re­la­ted to Linux.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-87-2-p0">This led them to in­ves­ti­ga­te just how big the Linux mar­ket was.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-87-3-p0">For ex­amp­le, Cal­de­ra’s Bryan Sparks said in 1996, “we have done some preli­mi­na­ry re­se­arch, both our­sel­ves and through third par­ties, and it’s a mil­li­on-plus—some peop­le say it’s re­ached 2 mil­li­on at this point, I’m more com­for­ta­ble say­ing I think we’re in a mil­li­on-plus users.” Marc Ewing from Red Hat was more bul­lish: “Our guess is that there are so­mew­he­re bet­ween 3 and 5 mil­li­on Linux users world­wi­de,” he said at this time.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-87-4-p0">Wha­te­ver the exact fi­gu­re, it was ex­tra­or­di­na­ry that there were mil­li­ons of GNU/Linux users at this point, just five years after Linus star­ted his ker­nel.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-87-5-p0">It was testi­mo­ny, above all, to the re­sults of the GNU/Linux de­ve­lop­ment pro­cess: code whose “qua­li­ty is often se­cond to none,” as Ewing put it in 1996.</span>
