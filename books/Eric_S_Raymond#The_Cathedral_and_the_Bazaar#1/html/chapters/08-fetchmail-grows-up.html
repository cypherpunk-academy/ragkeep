        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-1-2-p0">It gra­dual­ly daw­ned on me that I was no lon­ger en­ga­ged in a tri­vi­al per­so­nal hack that might hap­pen to be use­ful to few other peop­le.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-1-3-p0">I had my hands on a pro­gram that every ha­cker with a Unix box and a SLIP/PPP mail con­nec­tion re­al­ly needs.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-3-2-p0">You have to get pul­led into it by de­sign ideas so power­ful that af­ter­ward the re­sults just seem in­e­vi­ta­ble, na­tu­ral, even fo­reor­dai­ned.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-3-3-p0">The only way to try for ideas like that is by ha­ving lots of ideas—or by ha­ving the en­gi­nee­ring judgment to take other peop­les' good ideas bey­ond where the ori­gi­na­tors thought they could go.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-2-p0">Linus Tor­valds pus­hed the Minix con­cept fur­ther than An­d­rew pro­bab­ly thought it could go—and it grew into so­me­thing won­der­ful.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-4-3-p0">In the same way (though on a smal­ler scale), I took some ideas by Carl Har­ris and Harry Hoch­hei­ser and pus­hed them hard.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-5-3-p0">To make fetchmail as good as I now saw it could be, I'd have to write not just for my own needs, but also in­clu­de and sup­port fea­tures ne­cessa­ry to others but outs­ide my orbit.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-7-2-p0">And so it pro­ved.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-8-7-3-p0">Get­ting RFC 822 ad­dress par­sing right took me a re­mar­ka­b­ly long time, not be­cau­se any in­di­vi­du­al piece of it is hard but be­cau­se it in­vol­ved a pile of in­ter­de­pen­dent and fussy de­tails.</span>
