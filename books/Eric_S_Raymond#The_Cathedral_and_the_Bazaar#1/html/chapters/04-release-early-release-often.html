        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-22-3-p0">Each one ap­proa­ches the task of bug cha­rac­te­riza­t­i­on with a slight­ly dif­fe­rent per­cep­tu­al set and ana­ly­ti­cal tool­kit, a dif­fe­rent angle on the pro­blem.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-24-2-p0">In case there are se­rious bugs, Linux ker­nel ver­si­on are num­be­red in such a way that po­ten­ti­al users can make a choice eit­her to run the last ver­si­on de­si­gna­ted "sta­ble" or to ride the cut­ting edge and risk bugs in order to get new fea­tures.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-24-3-p0">This tac­tic is not yet sys­te­ma­ti­cal­ly imi­ta­ted by most Linux ha­ckers, but per­haps it should be; the fact that eit­her choice is avail­able makes both more attrac­tive.</span>
