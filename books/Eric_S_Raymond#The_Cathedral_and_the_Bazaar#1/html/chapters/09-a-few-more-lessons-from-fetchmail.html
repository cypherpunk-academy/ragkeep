        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-2-1-p0">The rc (con­trol) file syn­tax in­clu­des op­tio­nal `noise' key­words that are ent­i­re­ly igno­red by the par­ser.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-2-2-p0">The Eng­lish-like syn­tax they allow is con­sider­ab­ly more re­a­da­ble than the tra­di­tio­nal terse key­word-value pairs you get when you strip them all out.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-4-2-p0">Now, alt­hough I'm a con­vin­ced par­ti­san of the „make it a lan­gua­ge“ school of de­sign as ex­em­pli­fied by Emacs and HTML and many da­ta­ba­se en­gi­nes, I am not nor­mal­ly a big fan of „Eng­lish-like“ syn­ta­xes.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-5-2-p0">This is a cul­tu­ral le­ga­cy from when com­pu­ting re­sour­ces were ex­pen­si­ve, so par­sing sta­ges had to be as cheap and sim­ple as pos­si­ble.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-5-3-p0">Eng­lish, with about 50% red­un­dan­cy, loo­ked like a very in­ap­pro­pria­te model then.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-6-2-p0">With cheap cy­cles and core, ter­sen­ess should not be an end in its­elf.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-6-3-p0">No­wa­days it's more im­portant for a lan­gua­ge to be con­ve­ni­ent for hu­mans than to be cheap for the com­pu­ter.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-7-2-p0">One is the com­ple­xi­ty cost of the par­sing stage—you don't want to raise that to the point where it's a si­gni­fi­cant sour­ce of bugs and user con­fu­si­on in its­elf.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-7-3-p0">Ano­ther is that try­ing to make a lan­gua­ge syn­tax Eng­lish-like often de­man­ds that the „Eng­lish“ it speaks be bent se­rious­ly out of shape, so much so that the su­per­fi­ci­al re­sem­blan­ce to na­tu­ral lan­gua­ge is as con­fu­sing as a tra­di­tio­nal syn­tax would have been.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-9-8-2-p0">It's now­he­re near a ge­ne­ral-pur­po­se lan­gua­ge; the things it says sim­ply are not very com­pli­ca­ted, so there's litt­le po­ten­ti­al for con­fu­si­on in mo­ving men­tal­ly bet­ween a tiny sub­set of Eng­lish and the ac­tu­al con­trol lan­gua­ge.</span>
