        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-2-2-p0">One can test, debug and im­pro­ve in ba­zaar style, but it would be very hard to ori­gi­na­te a pro­ject in ba­zaar mode.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-2-3-p0">Linus didn't try it.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-4-2-p0">Many peop­le thin­king about the ba­zaar model as I have pre­sen­ted it have cor­rect­ly con­side­red this cri­ti­cal, then jum­ped from that to the con­clu­si­on that a high de­gree of de­sign in­tui­ti­on and cle­ver­ness in the pro­ject lea­der is in­dis­pensa­ble.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-5-3-p0">So does the lea­der/co­or­di­na­tor for a ba­zaar-style ef­fort re­al­ly have to have ex­cep­tio­nal de­sign ta­lent, or can he get by through le­ver­aging the de­sign ta­lent of others?</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-8-2-p0">There may be some truth to this; de­sign (as op­po­sed to co­ding or de­bug­ging) is cer­tain­ly my stron­gest skill.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-9-1-p0">But the pro­blem with being cle­ver and ori­gi­nal in soft­ware de­sign is that it gets to be a habit—you start re­fle­xi­vely ma­king things cute and com­pli­ca­ted when you should be ke­eping them ro­bust and sim­ple.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-13-2-p0">In order to build a de­ve­lop­ment com­mu­ni­ty, you need to attract peop­le, in­te­rest them in what you're doing, and keep them happy about the amount of work they're doing.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-10-13-3-p0">Tech­ni­cal sizz­le will go a long way towards ac­com­plis­hing this, but it's far from the whole story.</span>
