        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-13-10-2-p0">The pro­blem here seems to be that for a long time the Mo­zil­la dis­tri­bu­ti­on ac­tual­ly broke one of the basic rules of the ba­zaar model; it didn't ship with so­me­thing po­ten­ti­al cont­ri­bu­tors could ea­si­ly run and see working.</span>
