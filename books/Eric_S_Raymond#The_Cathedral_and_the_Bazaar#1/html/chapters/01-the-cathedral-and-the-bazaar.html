        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-1-2-p0">Who would have thought even five years ago (1991) that a world-class ope­ra­ting sys­tem could co­ale­sce as if by magic out of part-time hacking by se­veral thousand de­ve­l­o­pers scat­te­red all over the pla­net, con­nec­ted only by the te­nuous strands of the In­ter­net?</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-2-1-p0">Cer­tain­ly not I. By the time Linux swam onto my radar screen in early 1993, I had al­re­a­dy been in­vol­ved in Unix and open-sour­ce de­ve­lop­ment for ten years.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-2-2-p0">I was one of the first GNU cont­ri­bu­tors in the mid-1980s. I had re­leased a good deal of open-sour­ce soft­ware onto the net, de­ve­lo­ping or co-de­ve­lo­ping se­veral pro­grams (net­hack, Emacs's VC and GUD modes, xlife, and others) that are still in wide use today.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-2-3-p0">I thought I knew how it was done.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-3-1-p0">Linux over­tur­ned much of what I thought I knew.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-3-2-p0">I had been pre­aching the Unix gos­pel of small tools, rapid pro­to­typ­ing and evo­lu­tio­na­ry pro­gramming for years.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-3-3-p0">But I also be­lie­ved there was a cer­tain cri­ti­cal com­ple­xi­ty above which a more cen­tra­li­zed, a prio­ri ap­proach was re­qui­red.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-3-4-p0">I be­lie­ved that the most im­portant soft­ware (ope­ra­ting sys­tems and re­al­ly large tools like the Emacs pro­gramming edi­tor) nee­ded to be built like ca­the­drals, ca­re­ful­ly craf­ted by in­di­vi­du­al wi­zards or small bands of mages working in sple­ndid iso­la­ti­on, with no beta to be re­leased be­fo­re its time.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-4-1-p0">Linus Tor­valds's style of de­ve­lop­ment—re­lease early and often, de­le­ga­te ever­y­thing you can, be open to the point of pro­mis­cui­ty—came as a sur­pri­se.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-4-2-p0">No quiet, re­ver­ent ca­the­dral-buil­ding here—ra­ther, the Linux com­mu­ni­ty see­med to re­sem­ble a great bab­b­ling ba­zaar of dif­fe­ring agen­das and ap­proa­ches (aptly sym­bo­li­zed by the Linux ar­chi­ve sites, who'd take sub­mis­si­ons from an­yo­ne) out of which a co­he­rent and sta­ble sys­tem could see­mingly emer­ge only by a suc­ces­si­on of mi­ra­cles.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-5-1-p0">The fact that this ba­zaar style see­med to work, and work well, came as a dis­tinct shock.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-5-2-p0">Ass I lear­ned my way around, I worked hard not just at in­di­vi­du­al pro­jects, but also at try­ing to un­der­stand why the Linux world not only didn't fly apart in con­fu­si­on but see­med to go from strength to strength at a speed ba­re­ly ima­ginable to ca­the­dral-buil­ders.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-6-1-p0">By mid-1996 I thought I was be­gin­ning to un­der­stand.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-6-2-p0">Chan­ce han­ded me a per­fect way to test my theo­ry, in the form of an open-sour­ce pro­ject that I could con­scious­ly try to run in the ba­zaar style.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-6-3-p0">So I did—and it was a si­gni­fi­cant suc­cess.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-7-2-p0">I'll use it to pro­po­se some apho­risms about ef­fec­tive open-sour­ce de­ve­lop­ment.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-7-3-p0">Not all of these are things I first lear­ned in the Linux world, but we'll see how the Linux world gives them par­ti­cu­lar point.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-7-4-p0">If I'm cor­rect, they'll help you un­der­stand ex­act­ly what it is that makes the Linux com­mu­ni­ty such a foun­tain of good soft­ware—and, per­haps, they will help you be­co­me more pro­duc­tive yours­elf.</span>
