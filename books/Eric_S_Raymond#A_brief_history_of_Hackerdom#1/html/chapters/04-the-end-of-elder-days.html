        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-1-2-p0">The AR­PA­net/PDP-10 cul­tu­re, wed­ded to LISP and MACRO and TOPS-10 and ITS and SAIL.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-1-3-p0">The Unix and C crowd with their PDP-11s and VAXen and pokey te­le­pho­ne con­nec­tions.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-2-2-p0">But storm­clouds were gathe­ring over the Lab.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-2-3-p0">The PDP-10 tech­no­lo­gy ITS de­pen­ded on was aging, and the Lab its­elf was split into fac­tions by the first at­tempts to com­mer­cia­li­ze ar­ti­fi­ci­al in­tel­li­gence.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-2-4-p0">Some of the Lab's (and SAIL's and CMU's) best were lured away to high-pay­ing jobs at star­t­up com­pa­nies.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-3-4-p0">The Ber­ke­ley va­ri­ant of Unix run­ning on a VAX be­ca­me the hacking sys­tem par ex­cel­lence, and an­yo­ne with an eye on the fu­ture could see that mi­cro­com­pu­ters were gro­wing in power so ra­pidly that they were li­kely to sweep all be­fo­re them.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-5-2-p0">Levy eu­lo­gi­zed him as „the last true ha­cker“, a de­scrip­ti­on which hap­pi­ly pro­ved in­cor­rect.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-6-2-p0">His pro­ject was known as the GNU (Gnu's Not Unix) ope­ra­ting sys­tem, in a kind of re­cur­si­ve acro­nym.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-6-3-p0">GNU quick­ly be­ca­me a major focus for ha­cker ac­tivi­ty.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-6-4-p0">Thus, the spi­rit and tra­di­ti­on of ITS was pre­ser­ved as an im­portant part of the newer, Unix and VAX-cen­te­red ha­cker cul­tu­re.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-8-1-p0">It was also around 1982–83 that mi­cro­chip and local-area net­work tech­no­lo­gy began to have a se­rious im­pact on ha­cker­dom.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-8-2-p0">Ether­net and the Mo­to­ro­la 68000 mi­cro­chip made a po­ten­ti­al­ly po­tent com­bi­na­ti­on, and se­veral dif­fe­rent star­tups had been for­med to build the first ge­ne­ra­ti­on of what we now call work­sta­tions.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-4-9-2-p0">They were right, and their vi­si­on set the pat­tern for an ent­i­re in­dus­try.</span>
