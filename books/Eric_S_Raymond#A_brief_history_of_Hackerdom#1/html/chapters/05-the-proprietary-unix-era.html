        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-2-1-p0">It was also around this time that se­rious cracking epi­so­des were first co­ve­r­ed in the main­stream press—and jour­na­lists began to mis­ap­p­ly the term "ha­cker" to refer to com­pu­ter van­dals, an abuse which sadly con­ti­nues to this day.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-3-3-p0">Du­ring the 1980s ha­cker­dom was preoc­cu­p­ied by the soft­ware and tool-buil­ding chal­len­ges of get­ting the most use out of these fea­tures.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-4-3-p0">A cri­ti­cal fac­tor in its suc­cess was that the X de­ve­l­o­pers were wil­ling to give the sour­ces away for free in ac­cor­dance with the ha­cker ethic, and able to dis­tri­bu­te them over the In­ter­net.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-5-5-2-p0">But the last ITS ma­chi­ne shut down for good in 1990; the zea­lots no lon­ger had a place to stand and most­ly as­si­mi­la­ted to the Unix cul­tu­re with va­rious de­grees of grum­bling.</span>
