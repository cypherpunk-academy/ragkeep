        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-2-2-p0">They didn't call them­sel­ves "ha­ckers", eit­her, or any­thing in par­ti­cu­lar; the so­bri­quet "Real Pro­gram­mer" wasn't coi­ned until after 1980, re­tro­s­pec­tive­ly by one of their own.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-2-3-p0">But from 1945 on­ward, the tech­no­lo­gy of com­pu­ting attrac­ted many of the world's brigh­test and most crea­ti­ve minds.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-2-4-p0">From Eckert and Mauch­ly's first ENIAC com­pu­ter on­ward there was a more or less con­ti­nuous and self-con­scious tech­ni­cal cul­tu­re of en­thu­si­ast pro­gramm­ers, peop­le who built and play­ed with soft­ware for fun.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-3-1-p0">The Real Pro­gramm­ers ty­pi­cal­ly came out of en­gi­nee­ring or phy­sics back­grounds.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-3-2-p0">They were often ama­teur-radio hob­by­ists.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-3-3-p0">They wore white socks and po­ly­es­ter shirts and ties and thick glas­ses and coded in ma­chi­ne lan­gua­ge and as­sem­bler and FOR­TRAN and half a dozen an­ci­ent lan­gua­ges now for­got­ten.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-4-1-p0">From the end of World War II to the early 1970s, in the great days of batch pro­ces­sing and the "big iron" main­frames, the Real Pro­gramm­ers were the do­mi­nant tech­ni­cal cul­tu­re in com­pu­ting.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-4-2-p0">A few pie­ces of re­ve­r­ed ha­cker folk­lo­re date from this era, in­clu­ding va­rious lists of Mur­phy's Laws and the mock-Ger­man "Blin­ken­lights" pos­ter that still gra­ces many com­pu­ter rooms.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-5-2-p0">Sey­mour Cray, de­si­gner of the Cray line of su­per­com­pu­ters, was among the grea­test.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-5-3-p0">He is said once to have togg­led an ent­i­re ope­ra­ting sys­tem of his own de­sign into a com­pu­ter of his own de­sign through its front-panel swit­ches.</span>

        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-6-1-p0">The `Real Pro­gram­mer' cul­tu­re, though, was hea­vi­ly as­so­cia­ted with batch (and es­pe­cial­ly batch sci­en­ti­fic) com­pu­ting.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-6-2-p0">It was even­tual­ly eclip­sed by the rise of in­ter­ac­tive com­pu­ting, the uni­ver­si­ties, and the net­works.</span>
        
        <span class="book-sentence" id="s-1-6-3-p0">These gave birth to ano­ther en­gi­nee­ring tra­di­ti­on that, even­tual­ly, would evol­ve into today's open-sour­ce ha­cker cul­tu­re.</span>
